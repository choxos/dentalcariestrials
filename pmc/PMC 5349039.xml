                  <p>Class II box cavities were prepared in both proximal faces of 32 sound human third
molars with gingival margins located in either enamel or dentin/cementum.
Restorations were performed as follows: G1 (control): composite, conventional
light curing technique; G2: composite, soft-start technique; G3: amalgam/composite
association (amalcomp); and G4: resin-modified glass ionomer cement/ composite,
open sandwich technique. The restored specimens were thermocycled. Epoxy resin
replicas were made and coated for scanning electron microscopy examination. For
microleakage evaluation, teeth were coated with nail polish and immersed in dye
solution. Teeth were cut in 3 slices and dye penetration was recorded (mm),
digitized and analyzed with Image Tool software. Microleakage data were analyzed
statistically by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.</p>

                  <p>Leakage in enamel was lower than in dentin (p&lt;0.001). G2 exhibited the lowest
leakage values (p&lt;0.05) in enamel margins, with no differences between the
other groups. In dentin margins, groups G1 and G2 had similar behavior and both
showed less leakage (p&lt;0.05) than groups G3 and G4. SEM micrographs revealed
different marginal adaptation patterns for the different techniques and for the
different substrates.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The gingival margins of class II restorations are critical to the bonding process
because of minimal or total absence of enamel. The composite resin polymerization
shrinkage can produce the breakdown of the adhesive bonds. As a consequence, marginal
gaps may occur and induce tooth sensitivity and pulpal damages. In addition, the main
reason for failure of direct composite restorations has been related to the secondary
caries<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, which still has been
associated to both, poor marginal adaptation and sealing<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The open sandwich technique, using glass ionomer cement (GIC) and composite resin, has
been suggested as a better option to the conventional composite resin
technique<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The GIC is capable of chemically reacting with calcium
ions present in the tooth structure creating a bond between them, providing a better and
long-lasting sealing<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The addition of
resinous particles to increase the mechanical properties and decrease the solubility
made the exposure of the RMGIC to the oral environment less critical than its precursor
(GIC)<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Amalgam is a condensable material with the unique property of marginal auto-sealing by
oxide deposition with aging. The application of amalgam in the gingival part of the
proximal cavity complemented by composite resin (amalcomp technique) provided a
significant improvement in marginal seal compared to light-cured composite
restorations<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The polymerization shrinkage stress has been considered one of the main factors
responsible for the marginal adaptation and microleakage of composite resin
restorations<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This stress
relies on the monomer composition of the composite, and might be controlled by
modulations in the light activation process, which reduces the speed of the composite
polymerization. Therefore, the control of initial light irradiance has been associated
to the quality of the marginal seal in composite restorations<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Based on that, alternative light curing techniques,
such as the soft-start activation, have been advocated aiming to reduce the shrinkage
stress, with the same degree of conversion<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which could result in better marginal seal.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the gingival marginal seal and adaptation in class
II composite restorations using different restorative techniques. The tested null
hypothesis was that all restorative techniques produce similar performances.</p>

              <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
              <p>Specimen Selection and Cavity Preparation</p>
              <p>Thirty-two recently extracted human third molars were stored in saline at room
temperature until use. The research protocol was approved by the School of Medicine’s
Research Ethics Committee (018/2003 - UFPel, Brazil).</p>
              <p>Standard Class II slot cavities were prepared in both mesial and distal surfaces using
#1090 diamond burs (KG Sorensen, Barueri, SP, Brazil) mounted in a water-cooled
high-speed turbine. The buccolingual extension of the cavities was 3 mm. Axial walls
were prepared to a standard depth of 1 mm in dentin from the dentinoenamel junction. The
gingival wall was located approximately 1.0 mm short of the cementoenamel junction (CEJ)
in the mesial face (n=32) and 1.0 mm above CEJ in the distal face (n=32). The internal
angles were rounded and cavosurface margins were finished with gingival margin
trimmers<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <sec>
                <title>Restorative Procedures</title>
                <p>The prepared teeth were mounted between two dummy teeth using silicone (OK??)
impression putty to reproduce proximal contact. An individual metal matrix was
prepared for each tooth and stabilized with wooden wedges.</p>
                <p>Teeth were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=8) and were restored as follows:</p>
                <p>Group 1 (control): Composite resin/ conventional light curing: 35% phosphoric acid
etching was done for 20 s followed by water rinsing for 30 s, and excess water was
removed from the dentin surface with absorbent paper. Two consecutive coats of Single
Bond adhesive system (3M/ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA; batch no. 1FB) were applied onto the
cavity walls and light cured for 10 s with a halogen light source (Ultralux; Dabi
Atlante, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil; light irradiance = 450
mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Filtek Z-250 composite resin (3M/ESPE; shade B2; batch no. 2MX)
was inserted in 2 mm-thick oblique increments and light cured for 40 s.</p>
                <p>Group 2: Composite resin/soft-start technique: the restorative procedures were
similar to Group 1. However, in this group, the increments were light cured initially
from a distance of 10 mm from the occlusal surface (determined by a periodontal
probe) during 20 s followed by a 40-s curing time with the light guide tip contacting
the occlusal surface. The average distance from the gingival wall to the occlusal
surface was 7.96 mm in the dentin/cementum wall and 5.42 mm in the enamel wall.</p>
                <p>Group 3: Amalcomp: the adhesive procedures were the same as above described. However,
A 2-mm thick layer of amalgam (Logic Plus, batch no. 000250301, SDI, São
Paulo, SP, Brazil) was condensed in the cervical region and allowed to set for 5 min.
Two adhesive coats were applied to the amalgam and light cured for 10 s. Composite
resin increments were inserted and light cured for 40 s.</p>
                <p>Group 4: Open sandwich technique: Vitrebond RMGIC (Batch no. 2CY, 3M/ESPE) was
prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions and a 2mm thick layer of material
was injected into the cavity using a Centrix syringe and was light cured for 40 s.
The cavity walls and the RMGIC surface were etched for 20 s, washed and dried as for
Group 1. The adhesive system and the composite resin were used as previously
described.</p>
                <p>After 7 days of storage in distilled water, the teeth were removed from the silicone
and the restorations were finished and polished using 30blade carbide burs and
polishing disks (Sof Lex<sup>TM</sup>; 3M/ESPE) with diamond paste (FGM, Joinville,
SC, Brazil).</p>

                <title>Microleakage Test and Evaluation</title>
                <p>The teeth were thermocycled using 500 cycles from 5ºC to 55ºC with a
dwell time of 30 s. The apex of each tooth was sealed with epoxy resin and the entire
tooth surface was covered with two coats of nail varnish, except for the restorations
and 1 mm around their margins. The specimens were immersed in 0.5% basic fuchsin
solution for 24 h, followed by tap water washing for the same time. The specimens
were embedded in acrylic resin and mounted in a low-speed, automatic precision
cutting machine (Minitom, Struers, Copenhagen, Denmark). Three 1-mm thick mesiodistal
slices were obtained per tooth using a low-speed diamond wheel saw (Sultrade; Com.
Exp. Ltda, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) under water-cooling. The slices were
examined using a stereomicroscope adapted to a digital camera. Each slab was scanned
along with a millimeter scale and the digitized images were transferred to Image Tool
software (San Antonio Dental School, University of Texas Health Science, TX, USA) in
order to measure the length of dye penetration (in mm) along the gingival wall. Only
the slice presenting the highest degree of penetration in each specimen was
considered and recorded.</p>
                <p>The microleakage data were analyzed statistically using non parametric Kruskal-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney tests at 5% significance level.</p>

                <title>Qualitative Analysis of Marginal Adaptation</title>
                <p>Three specimens from each group were randomly selected. Impressions (Express; 3M/
ESPE - batch no. 0GLY2C6) were taken of the tooth/restoration margins and replicas
were obtained in epoxy resin (EMBED 812 KIT; EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA – batch no.
14120). The replicas were sputter-coated with gold-palladium and observed in a
scanning electron microscope (XL30, Phillips International Inc., Potomac, MD, USA) on
secondary electron image mode. Marginal adaptation was qualitatively evaluated
observing the presence of gaps and voids at the tooth/ material interface
(×200 magnification).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Microleakage tests have been widely employed to screen the seal efficiency of
restorations. Such tests face the challenge of reproducing the oral dynamics in an
<italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Probably, the biggest limiting factor is the huge
variability of methods, with no standardization, which impairs the comparison of the
results<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In addition, results
tend to present high variability, which must be taken into account when interpreting the
statistical analysis. In spite of these limiting aspects, microleakage was chosen in
this study because of its long-term report in literature. Furthermore, the test was
designed taking into consideration the most frequent choices in test variables, as
reported by Raskin, et al.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (2001) in
a systematic literature review.</p>
              <p>The boundary conditions are fundamental to create the necessary bond strength to
withstand the shrinkage stress<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and to
direct the shrinkage vectors toward the cavity walls<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Several factors can be considered as potentially interfering in
the adhesive process, namely the cavity depth, location, condition of the tissue and
wetness. Enamel is basically an inorganic tissue and, therefore, a more stable substrate
for adhesion, promoting a better marginal seal than dentin, as observed in the present
study.</p>
              <p>The soft-start technique (G2) produced no microleakage in enamel. In dentin/cementum
margins it (G2) produced a marginal seal similar to the conventional technique (G1),
which were lower than the other techniques (G3 and G4). This technique (G2) is based on
the retard of the polymerization shrinkage by reducing the initial light
irradiance<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. According to Lim, et al. <sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (2002), the result of this delay is a longer time for
the rearrangement of the composite molecules and for the stress release, which maintain
adhesive links without ruptures<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.
Thus, the conversion rate during this initial period is lower compared to the full light
irradiance. Nevertheless, it needs to be compensated by an increase in curing
time<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>A 10-mm distance was used to reduce light irradiance in the first 20 s of
polymerization. Yet, the real distance to the first composite increment in both, enamel
and dentin, was higher than 10 mm (about 15 mm in enamel and 18 mm in dentin). Even
though no measure of light irradiance was performed, one could infer a reduction of
light irradiance based on Mehl, et al. <sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (1997), who observed a 50% decrease in irradiance working with a
10mm distance. Between 10 and 20 mm, the reduction of light irradiance was around 50 and
37% respectively, and was considered by the authors a good initial irradiance for
improvement of the restoration seal. Failure in producing better seal in dentin margins
might be explained by the difficulty of obtaining a good adhesion with such complex
substrate, and is in accordance with previous reports<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The application of amalgam in the gingival floor of proximal boxes has been related to
good marginal seal<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. It allows the use
of the metallic matrix/wooden wedge that makes easier the reproduction of the proximal
contact and the cervical adaptation. Unlike the composite resin, amalgam does not create
pulling forces from the cavity and its condensation force is considered the most
important factor in its marginal adaptation<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In fact, when observed under SEM, the amalgam produced an adequate
adaptation to the enamel and a good adaptation to dentin. The advantageous auto-sealing
is time dependent and relies on the deposition of oxides<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. To avoid the occurrence of early microleakage on
amalgam restorations a liner such as copal varnish is indicated<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Previous studies observed a better
marginal seal in amalgam restorations when the cavity varnish was substituted by an
adhesive system<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In this study, a
single-bottle etch-andrinse adhesive system was used with the amalgam/composite
restorations. It was light cured before the insertion of the amalgam, what may have
avoided the micromechanical adhering of both materials and have caused the leakage
reported in the study. Demarco, et al. <sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (2001) obtained the best sealing results with the amalcomp technique
using a dual cure adhesive system (SBMPP) that probably created an intimate mechanical
adherence with the amalgam, which was not the case in this study. In fact, when compared
to the conventional technique, the amalcomp technique exhibited similar performance in
enamel and worse marginal seal in dentin margins. Yet, the amalcomp technique represents
a more sensitive and time-consuming technique, which could reduce its clinical
applicability<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>In this study, the open-sandwich technique was not able to provide a better sealing than
the other techniques. Fritz, et al.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
(1996) suggested dentin hybridization of dentin with adhesive system before RMGIC
application to warrantee a dentinal tubule sealing in case of failure at the interface.
In the present study, RMGIC was used without adhesive bonding agent, following the
manufacturer indications for the material used. SEM evaluation showed cohesive failure
of the RMGIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures 2D</xref> and 3). Due to the
powder/ liquid cement nature, these materials are very fragile. Apparently, the addition
of the resinous content did not improve sufficiently the strength of the material to
tensile loads. It seems that its brittleness did not allow it to withstand the shrinkage
forces during the composite polymerization. Also, like amalcomp technique, the open
sandwich technique is also a more sensitive and time-consuming procedure, which should
be taken into account when proposing a restorative technique.</p>
              <p>The null hypothesis was rejected since differences were observed between different
techniques in enamel and dentin.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Within the limitation of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study it can be suggest that: 1.
The soft-start technique produced no microleakage in enamel margins; 2. None of the
examined restorative techniques totally prevented dye penetration in dentin margins; 3.
Marginal adaptation varied in both substrates and from different restorative techniques
