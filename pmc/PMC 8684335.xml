                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Caries risk assessment is an essential element for managing and preventing dental caries in children. Individual caries risk assessment can be conducted to evaluate the presence or absence of single factors, or using multivariate models, a combination of factors. The subject has been extensively studied, but no previous research has compared whether a more elaborate and individualized method of caries risk benefits the patient than more straightforward strategies. Thus, this protocol evaluates the efficacy of two risk assessment methods for caries control in children, a simplified method based on caries experience evaluation and a multivariate method described in the literature.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-treatment trial protocol. Two groups will be tested for two forms of caries risk assessment: an individualized and detailed multivariate method based on the guidelines of the Caries Care International 4D and another simplified process, based only on caries experience in primary and/or permanent dentition, considering the presence of decayed, missing and filled teeth using the DMFT/dmft index. Participants will be children aged 8 to 11 years, followed up at 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome will be a composite outcome representing the number of tooth surfaces requiring operative intervention (account variable). In addition, the Shapiro–Wilk normality test and Student's t-test will be performed. A multivariate analysis using negative binomial regression will compare groups in the intention-to-treat population, considering a two-tailed significance level of 5%.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This is the first randomized clinical trial aiming to compare dental caries-related treatment and follow-up based on a detailed, multivariate and individualized assessment of caries risk in school-age children to a simpler risk assessment strategy based on caries experience. This study will define whether there are essential benefits to the patient that justify the choice of one method over the other.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par15">Dental caries is considered a multifactorial dynamic disease, determined by the interaction of biological, behavioral, and psychosocial factors related to the individual's environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There has been a continuous decline in the caries prevalence and lesions progression in the last decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, unequal distribution of the disease burden in the population is still observed, and poorer children with low access to dental services are more affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Authors have stated that caries risk assessment can prevent the onset of the disease or its evolution and, thus, could contribute to guide public interventions and allocate time and resources to those most needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to being considered an essential element for management and prevention of dental caries, caries risk assessment, could establish the appropriate follow-up appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">The main goals of caries risk assessment are determining the patient's probability of developing new caries lesions in a given period and the risk of present lesions progressing to more severe stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There are mainly two ways to assess individual caries risk: (a) simple assessment based on factor’s presence or absence, and (b) assessment by multivariate models, a combination of more than one variable, classifying the patient’s caries risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Several studies about caries risk assessment with children and adolescents were carried out and are summarized in systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most primary studies have cohort design and were conducted to determine isolated variables that would have adequate predictive power for developing new carious lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Those were unanimous in stating that the past caries experience is the factor with the strongest association with an increased risk of dental caries. In the cohort study by Hall-Scullin, et al., they show that children who had caries lesions in the primary dentition and those who were caries-free at this stage had very different trajectories in the development of new caries lesions in the permanent dentition; hence the authors suggest different prevention strategies for these two groups of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">However, other authors claim that past caries experience would not be the ideal prediction method, especially in the new era in which dentistry is of minimal intervention and non-operative approaches concerning the management of dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Multivariate methods have been proposed to improve this prediction power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some authors claim that multivariate models have better predictive power than individual clinical indicators, especially preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, to date, there is no scientific evidence that supports choosing one factor or method over another, and none are very accurate in predicting the development of new lesions. At most, they can be considered having moderate evidence level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">Although authors and clinical protocol guides have emphasized the importance of individualized caries risk assessment for the correct management and non-operative treatment of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], this assumption is mainly based on expert’s opinion. Furthermore, the studies on which the guides are based are of low methodological quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and are focused on identifying the factors or models that predict new injuries.</p>
              <p id="Par21">No study has been carried out to assess whether a more elaborate and individualized method of caries risk assessment, considering a combination of several factors, provides more effective prevention and treatment related to dental caries. Moreover, there is no information regarding potential benefit to the patient, compared to more straightforward strategies, as caries experience in primary and/or permanent dentition. This would ideally be answered through a randomized clinical trial comparing the two strategies.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Thus, a randomized clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate two methods of assessing children’s caries risk. This protocol will compare dental caries-related treatment and follow-up based on a detailed, multivariate and individualized assessment of caries risk in children to a more uncomplicated risk assessment strategy based on caries experience.</p>

The individualized and detailed method is based on several risk predictors, and its latest update proposes the classification of the patient as low and high risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Classification of caries risk according to the criteria</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2021_2010_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                  <p id="Par31">The risk assessment based only on caries experience in primary and/or permanent dentition, considering decayed, missing, or filled teeth by caries, according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], will be the criterion choice of the simplified group. Thus, children will be classified as low, with no past or current caries experience (DMFT/dmft = 0) and high risk, with history or current caries experience in primary and/or permanent dentition (DMFT/dmft &gt; 0) and will be treated and followed-up based on clinical caries exam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

The patient will be evaluated according to their presence or absence, resulting in a final sum that will classify the child as high or low risk. For example, a patient with any risk factor (red color) is considered high risk. Those with risk factors (black color) receive 1 positive point for each factor present. Those with caries protective factors receive 1 negative point. If the patient does not have risk factors in red, which already puts him at high risk regardless of the score, the risk of final caries will be given through a combination based on a summation of risk factors (+) (black color) and protective (−) (green color).

In addition to the standard questions aimed at providing comprehensive care to the child, the caregiver will be asked about the diet to identify sugar consumption and oral hygiene (regularity and use of fluoride toothpaste). This interview will address specific questions included in the risk assessment (criteria 8–16) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="Par34">The clinical examination will follow a sequence, initially the absence or presence of: thick dental plaque, areas of plaque stagnation (high biofilm retention), and erupting molars will be evaluated. Afterward, a trained and calibrated evaluator will assess the condition for dental caries according to the WHO criteria through the DMFT/dmft index (decayed, missing, and filled teeth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The mother's caries experience will be evaluated using the DMFT index only if the score referring to the mother's exam can change the classification; this will be the last item to be listed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The participant will be classified using both methods: simplified and multivariate, by the same researcher.

                  <p id="Par36">The multivariate group follows the protocols proposed by the Caries Care International 4D that guide prevention strategies and early management of dental caries. General advice on diet and oral hygiene are common for high and low-risk patients (brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste above 1000 ppm of fluoride). Patients classified at high risk are recommended to be approached with motivational interview techniques for behavior modification, prescription of mouthwash as one of the home care and clinical approaches including: fluoride applications (varnish or gel) after dental prophylaxis if the child has active carious lesions (two to four applications weekly) and sealant on all permanent molars. The scheduled return intervals for low-risk patients are six to eight months and high-risk patients three to four months. In these high-risk patients, the application of fluor gel or varnish is recommended at each visit.</p>
                  <p id="Par37">For the simplified group, care protocols that are a consensus in clinical practice were used, following the current routine in the unit (Dental School—UFPel). Both patients classified as high and low risk received general advice on diet and oral hygiene (brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste above 1000 ppm fluoride). Among the interventions and clinical approaches unique to high-risk patients in the simplified group are: sealing permanent molars on surfaces classified as at risk after evaluation, for example, molars with deep grooves and retention factors. And the fluoride applications (varnish or gel) after dental prophylaxis if the child has active caries lesions (two to four applications with a weekly interval). The maintenance of the return visits has the interval: patients classified as low risk nine to twelve months, high-risk patients five to six months the returns.</p>

Although the groups to which children will be allocated will not be revealed to children and their parents, due to differences in treatments and mainly different intervals for return visits in the two groups, it is difficult to maintain blinding throughout the study for all participants. Therefore, the outcome assessors at 12 and 24 months will be blinded to groups.

Thus, the primary outcome will be the sum of surfaces with new carious lesions involving dentin, restored surfaces that needed replacement, and those teeth needing endodontic treatment or extraction (accounting for 4 or 5 surfaces per tooth, for anterior or posterior teeth, respectively). If the tooth surface requires two types of treatment at different times, the treatment will be computed twice.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Secondary outcomes will be the components of the primary outcome considered separately: surfaces with new lesions involving dentin, restored surfaces in need of restoration replacement, teeth with episodes of pain, need of endodontic treatment and extraction. Besides that, costs accumulated for 24 months, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) will also be collected as secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par43">In order to assess the cost of going to the appointments during the 2 years of follow-up questions about travel will be collected: “What transport do you normally use to come to the appointments?”; “How many buses do you take to come?—If the person uses a bus.”; and “How long does it take, approximately, from leaving home until arriving at the dental school?”.</p>
                <p id="Par44">The HRQOL will be collected using the Brazilian version of the KIDSCREEN-52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and for OHRQOL the Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be used.

                <p id="Par45">For the economic evaluation, a specific analysis plan of economic economic will be prepared. The main economic hypothesis will be if using the multivariate (more complex) assessment may be an efficient manner of allocating resources. A societal perspective and a 24-month time horizon were adopted. Resources spent during the trial follow-up will be registered and then, appropriately valued as costs. The effects to be tested will be derived from the assessed outcomes: number of new operative interventions alongside 24 months, changes in DMFT after 24 months and Quality of life. Then, cost-effectiveness analyses will be performed.</p>

              <p id="Par69">The risk assessment for dental caries is still a challenge for Dentistry. It becomes even more complex in Pediatric Dentistry, as the child is in constant growth and development. The lack of well-designed studies leads to a series of caries risk proposals, based on one or several criteria, with different assessment systems. This heterogeneity of methods confuses dental professionals and makes the decision-making process difficult.</p>
              <p id="Par70">It is known that the dynamic and multifactorial process of caries disease has led researchers to consider important the risk assessment by multivariate methods, whether in the paper form model or computerized assessment. Standard tools are Cariogram, ADA, CAMBRA, and ICCMS™; many uses three or more caries risk categories. The Cariogram, an open-access software that refers to the probability of developing new caries lesions was used in the majority of well-designed studies. Still, the program's accuracy for children is limited, and its applicability becomes dependent on the use of computers, which is not a reality in different populations, making its generalization restricted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par71">The <italic>Caries Care International</italic> was developed to promote a patient-centered risk-based approach to dental caries management designed for the clinical dental practice, shares the same goals as the ICCMS™ system intended to help patients and dentists control the caries process and maintain health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The four interlinked steps in the cycle all start with a 'D': 1st D: Determine the risk of caries; 2nd D: Detect injuries, scale their severity and assess their activity status; 3rd D: Decide on the most appropriate care plan for the patient at that time; 4th D: Do—implementation of the treatment plan always seeking to preserve the dental structure and control of the patient. Therefore, they are referred to in Caries Care International as the four Ds. Caries risk assessment is the essential first step in the 4D cycle, personalized method that features two risk categories, low risk and high risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par72">There is a consensus that caries experience is the most obvious factor in predicting new caries lesions. Therefore, its application in older children would be indicated. Although it is considered an easy-to-apply and straightforward method, the accuracy of this indicator is still moderate. Thus, age is an essential factor to be considered. In younger children and preschoolers, the presence or absence of caries is not effective, as there was no time for the disease to manifest. In these cases, the multivariate models may have a more suitable predictive value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As it is a very comprehensive guide, the applicability of Caries Care International in clinical practice is very time-consuming and challenging for the clinician to understand. Developing a practical guide considering the relevant risk factors for the specific group of children would be an important contribution.</p>
              <p id="Par73">The motivation for this study is that it would be essential to establish safer and more effective parameters for this theme and test different methods (simplified and multivariate) to understand whether there is a difference between these two approaches. In addition, developing a well-designed randomized clinical trial, considered solid scientific evidence, is necessary to answer this research question relevant to clinical practice, but it still has several gaps.</p>
              <p id="Par74">The new calls of scheduled returns for each group were organized with a flexibility interval of around two months; for the multivariate group, the returns for low-risk patients are six to eight months and high-risk patients three to four months, and for the simplified group patients classified as low risk, returns are from nine to twelve months and high-risk patients from five to six months. It is considered an important alternative that enables the protocol's applicability in various scenarios with different logistics of appointments.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Among the limitations of this study, we highlight the sample, a restricted population with specific characteristics, high present or past experience of caries, who seek care or are referred to the service that is a reference in clinical pediatric care in the locality. Although the treatments will be carried out in the same place, a clinical unit, the contamination of information and experiences can be a reality among the patients' families. Nevertheless, it is believed that these possible limitations do not directly interfere with the course of the study, being moderated by the coordinating team of the study.</p>
              <p id="Par76">The hypothesis is that both methods present very similar and coincident results. Thus, parameters such as the patient's and dentist's vision, workplace setting can be decisive in the choice, the clinician could choose the one that best suits their practice and is readily applicable to their reality and that of his patient.</p>
