                  <title>Background &amp; objective</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The use of herbal medicines to treat common oral diseases increases rapidly. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is one of the most common oral mucosal diseases, which has an unclear etiology and could lead to severe pain and dysfunction. Cinnamaldehyde is a major component of cinnamon bark oil. Biological properties of cinnamaldehyde, such as antioxidant, antitumor, antifungal, cytotoxic, and anti-mutational characteristics, have been identified. Considering the prevalence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis and the importance of using herbal resources for treatment, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of mucosal adhesive patches containing Cinnamaldehyde on minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis lesions.

                  <p id="Par2">In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, patients were divided into two groups. The intervention group received three daily mucosal adhesive patches to be used in the morning, afternoon, and night. The control group also did the same with a placebo. To evaluate the healing and determine the diameter of the lesions, patients were clinically examined on days zero, 3, 5, and 7. The VAS scale evaluated pain at baseline and after each meal for seven days. The Fisher's exact test, t-test, Shapiro Wilk test, Friedman test, and the Mann–Whitney test were used to analyze the data using the SPSS 20 software.

                  <p id="Par3">There was no statistically significant difference in the mean diameter of the inflammatory lesion and pain intensity in the two groups in the baseline (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, the ulcer size was significantly reduced in the cinnamaldehyde group on the third, fifth, and seventh days of the study. Except for baseline, the mean pain intensity significantly decreased in the cinnamaldehyde group compared to the placebo group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par8">Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa. The prevalence of this lesion varies between 5 and 25% and occurs more often in individuals between the ages of 10 and 40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Aphthous lesions are circular or elliptical-shaped lesions with a specific margin covered with a white–gray membrane surrounded by an erythematous halo that could be extremely painful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Aphthous lesions involve the non-keratinized mucosa, particularly mucosa of lips, cheeks, soft palate, lateral and ventral surfaces of the tongue, and the floor of the mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">RAS is classified into three minor, major and herpetic forms based on clinical appearance (size and shape of the ulcers). The etiology of aphthous lesions is unknown; however, some factors are believed to be involved in its occurrence, including genetic factors, food allergens, superficial trauma, endocrine changes (menstrual cycle), stress, anxiety, and smoking cessation, some chemicals, and microbial agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">These factors can directly or indirectly alter the oxidant / antioxidant balance of the body and accelerate the production of free radicals. A free radical is commonly an atomic or molecular sample with one or more unpaired electrons in its structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most important free radicals in the biological system are oxygen-based radicals. Other reactive compounds are known as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Oxidative stress occurs when the intracellular concentrations of ROS are higher than the physiological levels produced inside or outside the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Increased oxidative stress and oxidant/antioxidant imbalance are essential for inflammatory reactions of oral aphthous lesions. Conditions such as viral and bacterial infections, hyperthermia, and UV radiation can result in oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Different treatments are used to heal oral aphthous ulcers, including 1- local anesthetics such as Lidocaine spray or gel that alleviate symptoms and reduce the healing period. 2- anti-inflammatory and antiseptic medications such as mouthwashes containing chamomile extract or chlorhexidine. 3- Topical corticosteroids such as Triamcinolone, and 4- Topical treatments with Tetracycline that alleviate the pain and reduce the healing period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other therapeutic methods have also been evaluated, including toothpaste containing specific enzymatic compounds that reduce aphthous attacks and alleviate pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">For centuries, treatment with medicinal herbs has been the only source available to numerous groups and tribes. Today, plants are used in complementary medicine to treat, reduce or prevent many diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recently, the attention given to herbal medications and their traditional use has increased globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many patients tend to use herbal medicine regarding the side effects of chemical drugs.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Some studies have reported the effectiveness of Chamomile and Aloe Vera in the treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis as flavonoid compounds in these plants reduce the severity of ulcers with their anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In another study, Myrtus communis effectively reduced the pain, ulcer size, and erythema in patients with aphthous ulcers and improved their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cinnamomum Cassia is an evergreen tree in southern China and is widely cultivated in other parts of Asia in the south and east Asia (India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has traditionally been used to treat erectile dysfunction, gastritis, blood circulatory disorders, and inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde compound and the main ingredient of cinnamon oil (about 65%), widely used as a flavoring agent in foods and beverages such as ice cream, sweets, and chewing gum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The biological properties of cinnamon oil, such as peripheral vasodilatory, antitumor, antifungal, cytotoxic, and anti-mutation characteristics, are mainly attributed to cinnamaldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, despite the various biological activities of cinnamaldehyde, its mechanism for preventing cell growth is currently unknown. Some studies suggest that Cinnamaldehyde prevents the growth of microorganisms using its aldehyde structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cinnamaldehyde inhibits IL-1β and TNF-α in macrophages and reduces the active oxygen species (ROS). It also reduces the phosphorylation of protein kinase stimulated by lipopolysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Considering the prevalence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis and the importance of utilizing herbal resources to treat diseases, this study aimed to treat patients with minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis by developing a Cinnamaldehyde mucoadhesive patch.</p>

                <p id="Par18">10-mg cinnamaldehyde mucoadhesive tablets were developed with different proportions of adhesive polymers (such as Carbopol HPMC K4M) alone and mixed. The pharmaceutical drug and polymer were mixed. After complete mixing, the magnesium stearates were added, and the tablets were made using direct compression. Evaluation of changes in weight, hardness, erosion, tensile strength, and value determination were measured by spectrophotometry. The number of active compounds in the tablets after 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 h was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry in at least three samples.</p>
                <p id="Par19">The mucoadhesive strength of the evaluated formulations was determined using a sodium alginate gel; to do so, a spool and a string attached to the tablet were used. After the tablet touched the gel surface, the amount of force needed to separate the tablet from the gel surface was measured by pouring water into the bottom of the string container. After calculating the weight force applied to detach the tablet, the weight was multiplied by the gravity acceleration. Based on the tablet surface area, the adhesion force per area unit was determined in N/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                <p id="Par22">The examiner and the patients were blinded. All patients in the two groups were blinded and asked to refer to the clinic within the first 24 h after the appearance of the aphthous lesions. This period was considered as the baseline (day zero). In the first group, patients were taught how to use three mucoadhesive patches and were asked to use them daily in the morning, afternoon, and night. Each individual was asked to avoid eating and drinking for 30 min after using the patches. In the control group, the same was done with a placebo. Patients were clinically examined on days 0, 3, 5, and 7 to evaluate the pain intensity and healing of the ulcers. The examiner was blinded and was unaware of the medication each patient was receiving. Metal calibers were used to determine the diameter of the ulcers and the surrounding inflammatory zone (by millimeters) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients were also asked to select the pain intensity according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) criteria. This scale consists of a 10-cm line in which zero indicates no pain and ten indicates the maximum pain. The patient marked a point representing their pain on this scale and used the numeral scale (e.g., from one to ten) to estimate the pain intensity. Patients were asked to report the VAS 3 times a day after each meal. Usually, pain stimulation in the oral cavity reaches its maximum after mechanical and chemical stimulation. Eating and chewing stimulate the oral mucosa by mechanical stimuli caused by the presence of food particles as well as chemical stimuli derived from the presence of acids, spices, and salt in the food. Therefore, the measurement of pain during meals can accurately reflect the overall pain of the oral mucosa. Patients with a pain score of 1 and ulcer size of less than 1 mm were considered to be healed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">The present study investigated the effect of Cinnamaldehyde mucoadhesive patches on recurrent minor aphthous stomatitis. According to the results, the size of the aphthous ulcers in the cinnamaldehyde group was significantly reduced compared to the control group. According to the mentioned criteria, the aphthous lesions in the intervention group were considered improved on the fifth day. The mean diameter of the inflammatory zone of the placebo group was more than 1 mm on the seventh day, and no complete improvement was observed in the aphthous lesions of this group. The pain intensity was significantly different between the two groups during the study days except for baseline. The decreasing pain trend was higher in the cinnamaldehyde group than in the placebo group. The mean pain intensity in the intervention group was less than one on the fourth day. Painless conditions were reported in the intervention group on the sixth and seventh days of the study. While in the placebo group, even on the seventh day of the study, the mean pain intensity was higher than 1.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a common disorder of the oral cavity diagnosed by pain and inflammation of the oral mucosa. Due to the unknown etiology of the lesion, a definitive treatment was not obtained for RAS due to its nonspecific treatment. The most important therapeutic goals are to alleviate pain and disability and reduce inflammatory responses and recurrences of the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial effects of Cinnamaldehyde include decreased production of prostaglandin E2 and inhibition of cyclooxygenase, two expressions (COX-2). As a result, a significant reduction in interleukin-1-beta increased glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity, and bactericidal properties against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are among the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">Muhammad et al<italic>.</italic> reported that Cinnamaldehyde significantly reduces the production and secretion of interleukin 8. Also, it prevents the activation of NF-KB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Molania et al. studied the effects of Cinnamaldehyde on mucositis and salivary antioxidant capacity in gamma-irradiated rats. The mean mucositis incidence in irradiated rats in the cinnamaldehyde group was lower than in the control group (normal saline). They attributed the cause of this result to the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant effects of Cinnamaldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">In a study by Molania et al<italic>.,</italic> the anti-inflammatory effects of Cinnamaldehyde mouthwash in patients with gingivitis showed no statistical significance compared to chlorhexidine. They suggested that Cinnamaldehyde can be considered as a herbal mouthwash for improving the gingival condition without the side effects of chlorhexidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Similar clinical trials conducted on the same topic in human patients suggest that oral mucosa adhering agents can be considered as the first-line treatment for minor aphthous ulcers. Non-pharmaceutical products are reliable sources for the appearance of new therapeutic approaches due to their fewer side effects and higher patient acceptance and desire. Applying a coating on aphthous ulcers considerably reduces the patient’s pain, improves the healing, and eliminates the need for patients to use antibiotics or any other form of the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">Yao et al. Conducted a study on the effect of Cinnamaldehyde on stress in rats. They stated that cinnamaldehyde extract has antidepressant effects on stress conditions in middle-aged rats by reducing the amount and activity of cyclooxygenase, two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to the former relevant studies, it seems that a significant reduction in the size of the aphthous lesion and the severity of pain in patients of the cinnamaldehyde group compared to the placebo group is related to the anti-inflammatory and analgesic or antioxidant properties of Cinnamaldehyde in the present study. According to the results of the present study, mucoadhesive patches showed ease in use and also short-term pain relief in patients with RAS, which attracted more patient satisfaction and cooperation and resulted in better therapeutic effects.</p>

                <title>Strength and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par35">We believe that this was the first study to examine the impact of Cinnamaldehyde mucoadhesive patches on aphthous ulcers. Therefore, the lack of similar studies due to the novelty of the subject is one of the main limitations of the present study. It is recommended to conduct more studies with a larger sample size to achieve more reliable results. Also, the lack of supervision and direct access to patients during the seven days of the stud can be listed as another limitation of the present study.</p>
