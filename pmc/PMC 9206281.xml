                  <p id="Par1">Root debridement procedures for the treatment of periodontal diseases, produces root surface irregularities and smear layer on the root surface that can adversely affect the healing of periodontal tissues. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the surface texture of root after hand instrumentation with Gracey curette, After Five curette, and Mini Five curette.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A randomised, controlled clinical trial was conducted with 120 participants clinically diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. Participants were equally randomised into four groups, with parallel treatment assignment of scaling and root planning using Gracey Curettes, After five and Mini five curette, and a control group with no instrumentation. Mobile teeth of these patients were then extracted atraumatically and analysed under a Scanning Electron Microscope and graded for "Roughness and Loss of Tooth substance index" and "Smear layer index." Cross Tabulation was made between the test groups (Control, Gracey Curette, After five, and Mini Five) versus "Roughness and Loss of Tooth substance Index" and "Smear Layer Index." A Chi-square test with Bonferroni correction was used to determine the graded distribution among the groups.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">In the control group, 73.3% of the teeth showed grade 1 roughness. In the Gracey group, 56.7% showed grade 2 roughness; in the After 5 group, 70% showed grade 3 roughness; in the Mini 5 group, 76.7% showed grade 3 roughness. A significant association was found between roughness scores and the use of individual instruments. Regarding smear layer formation, 46.7% of teeth showed a grade 4 smear layer in the control group. 50% of teeth showed grade 2 smear layer thickness in the Gracey group. In the After 5 group, 73.3% of teeth showed a grade 1 smear layer, while in the Mini 5 group, 80.0% showed a grade 1 smear layer. The use of individual instruments was significantly associated with the smear layer scores.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Gracey curettes produced relatively smoother root surfaces with less smear layer formation than After Five and Mini Five curettes, which produced relatively more roughened root surfaces with thicker smear layer formation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par7">Root instrumentation is an integral component of surgical and non-surgical therapy of periodontitis that may leave root surfaces rough and irregular resulting in increased smear layer formation. However, periodontal healing is better in the absence of a smear layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An important goal of surface root roughness is to prevent the formation of new plaque deposits and to provide a biocompatible surface for the adhesion of periodontal fibroblasts, rather than bacteria. Therefore, selecting an optimal scaling hand instrument is vitally important as it can impact clinical outcomes such as clinical attachment loss, pocket depth, and bleeding upon probing.</p>
              <p id="Par8">A growing body of evidence suggests that plaque and calculus are the principal etiological agents of periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Roughened root surface accumulation favors bacterial attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The calculus is the ideal substrate for the colonisation of subgingival microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, anti-infective treatment and root instrumentation aim to eliminate the cause by periodically mechanically debriding this diseased root surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">An earlier belief was that bacterial endotoxins were tightly bound to root surfaces, so aggressive root planning was carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The current evidence proposes that there is weak adherence of bacterial endotoxin to the root surface, so aggressive root planing and intentional removal of the infected cementum and root surface are not necessary to heal periodontal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, root instrumentation must be performed with instruments that remove minimal root substances and effectively disrupt the biofilm and remove calculus. Numerous studies have been conducted to determine which instruments lead to less root roughness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While some believe that ultrasonic instruments are better at removing plaque and biofilm, others claim that hand instruments, such as curettes, are more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The ideal treatment would provide effective debridement and preserves the tooth structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Clinically, the surface roughness of intraoral hard tissues plays an important role in retaining bacteria in biofilms of plaque. Calculus and biofilm are not simply organic deposits on the root surfaces, but they are embedded in the cemental irregularities, which act as a reservoir for endotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has been established that increased roughness results in greater adhesion of bacteria and biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to Bollen et al., an increase in surface roughness of these hard substances from 0.2 to 0.8 µm significantly affects plaque and biofilm formation. Therefore, an acceptable "Threshold Roughness" was proposed as "0.2 µm" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">A root surface that is diseased or has deposits of smear layer does not provide a favorable environment for cell attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. During root-planing, the diseased root surfaces are covered by a smear layer made up of infected root cementum, toxins of bacteria, plaque, and calculus remnants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The primary goal of scaling and root planing is to encourage the formation of a new epithelial attachment resulting from the migration of the periodontal ligament to the cleaned root surfaces. The smear layer interferes with the adhesion and formation of new attachments in most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Smear layers form after root debridement, causing a barrier between the root surface and periodontal cells, altering the healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The goal of root treatment procedures is to make the root biologically compatible with the host tissues for optimal healing and better clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">According to Brannstorm, under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), the smear layer appears to be amorphous, granular, and irregular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Goldman et al<sup>.</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported its thickness between 1 and 5 µm depending on the cutting instrument's sharpness and type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For the fibrous reattachment to occur, the fibroblasts must contact the root surfaces; otherwise, a long junctional epithelium will form. Matheus Andre Muller investigated the effect of different Gracey curettes on the roughness of the root surfaces of teeth through SEM and found that the quality of the curette's cutting surface significantly affected root surface homogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Colette Landry compared Gracey curette with the Curvette Sub 0 curette to measure their effects on root roughness. Based on root surface microroughness, he concluded that Curvette Sub 0 type of curettes resulted in rougher roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

This study evaluated the efficiency of curettes in terms of relative root roughness. The Gracey curette had a greater mean curette efficiency of 3.46 mm versus 2.77 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

Based on different methodologies, these studies have produced variable and inconclusive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. While there is no universally accepted method for root planning and scaling, hand instruments produce smoother and cleaner results. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted comparing conventional hand instruments such as the Gracey curette with contemporary hand instruments such as the After Five and Mini Five curettes.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The rationale of the present study is based on the fact that all forms of inflammatory gum diseases are managed by debridement, and therefore an essential aspect of periodontal therapy is the instrumentation of the root surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In periodontal treatment, the goal is to produce healthy and regenerating roots that are biologically adequate, acceptable, and smooth enough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In clinical conditions, tooth substance loss is also affected by the shape and design of the instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is essential to remove as minimal as possible of the tooth structure because it can lead to serious complications in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As a result, this trial was conducted due to limited and inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of modified versions of curettes on root topography.</p>

Mini Five curettes are those in which the terminal shank is elongated by 3 mm, and the blade is reduced to half-length of After Five or a standard Gracey curette, and the blade is 10% thinner than the standard Gracey curette. The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate the effects of Gracey, After Five, and mini-Five curettes on root surface roughness and deposition of the smear layer using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p>

The level of the free gingival margin was marked with a small diamond round bur size 009 (DIA-Burs MANI) on a high-speed handpiece following instrumentation by curettes. This groove provided a landmark for evaluation under the scanning electron microscope. A control group was taken to compare the SEM photographs of instrumented test groups and non-instrumented control groups and to discern the difference between indentation marks produced by the curettes and the presence of smear layer before and after using the curettes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par45">It has been well established that there is no significant difference in periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment levels, or bleeding upon probing when using ultrasonic instruments or manual instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In contrast, there is a substantial difference in root roughness when using manual and ultrasonic instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Regarding hand instruments, there is a paucity of studies that have compared the effects of debridement on root structure using separate hand instruments like Gracey, After Five, and Mini Five. In this study, the effects of the different curettes on root surface ultra morphology were examined in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par46">There were almost 62.5% males and 37.5% females in the present study. Studies have shown that males are more likely to develop periodontitis than females, suggesting gender differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">There is scarce evidence comparing the effects of Gracey, After Five, and Mini Five curettes on root surfaces after debridement. In one study by Renato V.Alves, Gracey curettes were compared to Mini curettes (Mini Five) to evaluate the difference in trauma from instrumentation in terms of immediate attachment level before and after scaling. Renato concluded that root instrumentation causes an average trauma depth of 0.76 mm. No significant differences were found between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Matthew Andre conducted another study to compare the effects of different brands of Gracey curettes no 5/6, such as carbon steel and stainless steel, on root roughness and topography. He suggested that the quality of the cutting edge of the curette exerts a difference in the topography of the root surface. His study showed that stainless steel millennium had the most homogeneous root surface. In our study, in terms of smoothness, Gracey’s curette produced a smoother root surface compared to After Five and Mini Five Curettes, consistent with the study mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">Based on the results of the current study, which was an in vivo design and performed under SEM, we found that the Mini Five and After Five curettes produced greater root roughness than the Gracey curettes. These results were in accordance with the study by C.Landy. In vitro, he compared the long shank, short blade curette against the conventional Gracey curette variant (Curvette Sub-0) using a profilometer. He conducted the study on the maxillary and mandibular incisors set on the manikins and assessed the roughness of the root surface. His results verified that the test curette (Curvette-0) caused greater root roughness, although it was superior in removing the test material subgingivally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">In the present study, all the test groups that are Gracey, After Five, and Mini Five curettes, demonstrated some degree of gouging and cracks of varying sizes on the root surfaces. The root surfaces also exhibited deep scratches after root instrumentation. These results were congruent with many other studies that showed the presence of cracks and gouging with hand instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">Regarding smear layer production due to instrumentation with different curettes, the present study showed that the control group had almost absent or small residues of smear layer while all other instrument groups showed the presence of smear layer. These results correspond to one study by Priscilla Barbosa, in which root topography was analysed after different root treatments. In this study, the control specimens showed no smear layer, while the group scaled with Gracey curette showed the presence of a smear layer as observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, in our study Gracey Curette showed a relatively less amount of smear layer compared to After Five and mini Five curettes. Mini Five and After Five showed a thick smear layer, while Gracey curette showed mostly a thin smear layer. These results are consistent with a study by Giles Gagnot in which two periodontists compared the root treatments using Gracey curettes and a mini-insert ultrasonic instrument under scanning electron microscopy. Compared to Periodontist B, fewer smear layers were produced on teeth treated by Periodontist A than on teeth damaged by scratching and cementum loss, with more smear layers shown by Periodontist B. A difference in cementum damage was caused by differences in lateral pressure exerted by the two periodontists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par51">Similarly, a recent clinical trial that evaluated clinical outcomes, chairside time, and post-treatment hypersensitivity using Gracey curettes, ultrasound and diamond burs revealed that Gracey curettes and ultrasound improved clinical performance attachment levels compared to diamond burs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our study provides the morphological basis for achieving better clinical outcomes with Gracey Curettes due to reduced root roughness and thin smear layer production. The results of this study are limited to single-rooted teeth only. While SEM is a convenient method for qualitative surface morphology analysis, profilometry is more suitable for quantitative analysis and could be used for a more comprehensive analysis of tooth root surfaces.</p>

            <sec id="Sec18">
              <title>Recommendations</title>
              <p id="Par52">In the future, more studies are needed to assess the ultra-morphology of root surfaces produced by different hand instruments, as there are few studies and inconsistent results. Different methodologies and techniques may be used to determine the results. More rigorous studies must be conducted because of the paucity of research on long-shank curettes.</p>

            <sec id="Sec19">
              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par53">Gracey curettes produced a relatively smoother root surface with less smear layer formation than After Five and Mini Five curettes, which produced a relatively roughened root surface with a thicker smear layer. There was no difference between Mini Five and After Five in root roughness and smear layer. Differential results may be caused by the sharpness of instrument blades and variations in the diameter of the blade and shank length. Studies are needed in this area to determine the impact of these new curettes on root morphology.</p>
