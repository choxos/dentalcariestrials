                  <p id="Par2">Thirty-six implants were inserted in patients seeking for replacement of non-restorable maxillary anterior and premolar teeth (esthetic zone) by immediate implant. Patients were randomly distributed into three equal groups, twelve implants in each group. Group 1 received Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) into the jumping distance, Group 2 received Xenograft into the jumping distance and Group 3 received Alloplastic bone grafting material into the jumping distance. Implant stability by measuring the changes in Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA), peri-implant pocket depth, marginal bone loss and changes in buccal bone thickness were evaluated during follow up periods. All the clinical and radiographic data were subjected to statistical analysis by One Way ANOVA test and the Post Hoc Tukey test.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">The indications for dental implant treatment options have greatly expanded in recent years due to development in biomaterials and clinical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dental implants have been successfully used to replace missing teeth, and different insertion and loading protocols have been developed from the original protocol to facilitate quicker and less difficult surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Original protocol (gold standard) recommended a 6- to 12-month waiting time before implant placement in cases where a tooth had to be extracted and replaced. New methods that involve implant placement during tooth extraction have been developed. This protocol is called immediate implant placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since, the first report of the placement of a Tübinger dental implant into a fresh extraction socket, there has been increasing interest in this technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Immediate implant placement has an overall survival rate of 98.5%, while delayed implant placement has a survival rate of 98.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The possible benefits of immediate implant placement have been suggested to include shorter treatment period, more patient comfort, fewer surgical procedures, optimal three-dimensional implant positioning, preservation of alveolar bone, and better soft tissue contour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">In contrast, immediate implant placement has some disadvantages including, lack of control of the final implant position, difficulty of achieving primary stability, incomplete soft tissue closure over the extraction socket, inability to inspect all aspects of the extraction site for infection and difficulty in preparing the osteotomy due to bur movement (chatter) on the walls of the extraction site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">After tooth extraction, the alveolar socket frequently has dimensions larger than the implant's diameter, creating a space between the implant's surface and the alveolar bone walls in the recipient site. This area is designated as the jumping distance or the peri-implant gap. The peri-implant gap affects osseointegration and implant stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">The buccal aspect of an implant is of great concern, especially in the aesthetic zone (between the second contralateral premolars), because the buccal bony plate is thin and its resorption can result in soft tissue recession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], so the peri-implant gap must be filled with bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Defects &lt; 2 mm can be filled with bone without the need for bone grafts or the usage of barriers. The success of immediate implant procedures may be adversely affected by large gaps, as has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Regarding the best methods to achieve the following goals—optimal bone fill in the gap, the highest level of coronal bone to implant contact (BIC), the least amount of buccal bone resorption, and the least amount of soft tissue recession— the best surgical approach for treating the buccal gap is debatable and unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For the treatment of the buccal gap, a variety of methods, such as the use of barrier membranes and grafting materials, have been employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">The peri-implant gap has been filled using several bone grafting materials. Autograft is the gold standard for bone grafting materials but it has some limitations such as the need of a second surgical site, limited volume and size mismatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">Growth factors, such as Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) and bone morphogenic proteins, have been used to stimulate bone formation in the defective sites, as has been reported in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In bone augmentation procedures, PRF has been introduced as an additional or replacement material to guide new bone formation. According to Choukroun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], PRF is a unique technique for concentrating platelets (preparation without thrombin). According to in vitro studies, PRF improves cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and osteogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, PRF inhibits osteoclastogenesis, reduces inflammation, and promotes the expression of many growth factors in mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">The fibrin clot formed during the production of traditional PRF or its modification, is a three-dimensional scaffold that replaces the extracellular matrix in cell regeneration and newly formed vessels. Platelets trapped between fibrin fibers, B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, stem cells and neutrophils, as well as secreted growth factors such as TGF-1, PDGF, and VEGF, play a role in healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In clinical applications, PRF has been used in the treatment of periodontal defects, sinus floor elevation, and preservation of the alveolar ridge after tooth extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of different gap filling materials in immediate implant in anterior and premolar regions of maxilla. The primary objective was to assess alveolar bone loss and changes in buccal bone thickness radiologically using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and the secondary objective was to assess various clinical parameters such as implant stability by measuring the changes in Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) and peri-implant pocket depth.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The hypothesis was that the peri-implant alveolar bone loss, changes in buccal bone thickness and soft tissue health in immediate implants with a jumping distance grafted with PRF would be the same as those grafted with Xenograft or Alloplastic bone grafting materials.</p>

                <p id="Par28">Thirty-six patients, nineteen females and seventeen males with an average age 33 years (range from 19 to 47), were included in this study. They were chosen from the Outpatient Clinic in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt, for replacement of non-restorable maxillary anterior and 1<sup>st</sup> premolar teeth (esthetic zone) by immediate implant. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Dentistry, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt, approved the current study in compliance with the seventh revision of the Helsinki Declaration in 2013 (A0103023OS). The study was following CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials.

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p id="Par29">The total sample size was determined to be 10 implants in each group using G*power version 3.0.10 to calculate sample size-based t test = 2.31, 2-tailed, α error = 0.05 and power = 90.0% with effect size (2.63). To account for potential attrition by 20%, two additional implants were added to the total sample size (12 implants in each group). This calculation was based on a previous study by Oates and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>

Alexandria Co. for Pharmaceuiticals and Chemical Ind., Alexandria, Egypt.), a three-line incision was made, and the mucoperiosteal flap was reflected. Atraumatic extraction of the tooth/root was then initiated by using a periotome (Helmut Zeph, Medizintechnik GMBH, Seitingen-Oberflacht, Germany) to sever the periodontal ligament attachments and preserve the socket walls followed by using suitable extraction forceps (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, C, D and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). After tooth extraction, the socket was checked for the integrity of its four walls. If the buccal bone was fractured during the extraction or there was fenestration/dehiscences, the patient was excluded from the study. To remove any granulation tissue that might have been there, the socket underwent a cautious, thorough curettage. For tension-free primary closure, a periosteal release incision was made.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The final decision regarding the size of the implant was made after assessing the dimensions of the socket. Drilling was done in the right direction at 600 to 800 rpm. Depending on the implant size, sequential drilling with abundant irrigation was done until the ideal dimensions were achieved. The sterile implant package was opened, and with gentle, steady finger pressure, the implant was placed in its proper location with a manual ratchet (40 Ncm of torque) (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A).

                <p id="Par39">The buccal jumping gap in Group 1 was packed using PRF. Platelet-rich fibrin preparation, around 5–10 ml of whole venous blood was collected in each of the two sterile vacutainer tubes without anticoagulant. The vacutainer tubes were then placed in a centrifugal machine (Laboratory Centrifuge, Jiangsu, China) at 3000 rpm (800 gm) for 10 min, after which it settled into the following layers: red lower fraction containing red blood cells, upper straw coloured cellular plasma and the middle fraction containing the fibrin clot. The upper straw coloured layer was then removed and middle fraction was collected, 2 mm below lower dividing line, which was the PRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The gap between the walls of the socket and the dental implant was filled with PRF, which was delicately placed and compressed around the implant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). For Group 2, the buccal jumping gap was packed using Xenograft (Creos xenogain®, Nobel Biocare, Zürich-Flughafen, Switzerland) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B), while for Group 3, the buccal jumping gap was packed using Alloplastic β-tricalcium phosphate (R.T.R Syringe, β-TCP Synthetic granules, Septodont, France.).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Alloplast Group. <bold>A</bold> The preoperative panoramic radiograph showing horizontal root fracture of upper right central tooth. <bold>B</bold> The tooth after extraction. <bold>C</bold> The collagen membrane after its application. <bold>D</bold> The primary closure of the flap. <bold>E</bold> An immediate postoperative cross-sectional image of CBCT. <bold>F</bold> A cross-sectional CBCT image taken 18 months postoperative.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2023_3678_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>

              <p id="Par58">Immediate implant placement has highly predictable means of tooth replacement and shows high success rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, attaining positive results following immediate implant placement depends on a clear diagnosis and treatment planning. Immediate implant insertion is a sensitive procedure, so certain factors must be carefully taken into account before the procedure is carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par59">The area from the upper 1<sup>st</sup> premolar to the maxillary tuberosity is considered posterior region from a prosthetic point, but anatomically, the bone quality in the upper 1<sup>st</sup> premolar area is similar to the canine region than the molar region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In our study, non-restorable maxillary teeth from right first premolar to left first premolar were selected to be replaced with immediate implant placement.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Before implant placement, the dimensions of the socket must be evaluated to establish the length and diameter of the implant. To obtain primary stability, the drilling extended 3–4 mm apically to engage the bone beyond the apex of the extraction socket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, this ensures that the implant will be positioned 1–2 mm below the alveolar crest to achieve an appropriate bone level at the time of implant exposure and to maintain a favorable prosthetic position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par61">An essential step in preventing infection and epithelial downgrowth at the implant site is primary flap closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A periosteal releasing incision was made, and a flap was cronally adjusted to achieve primary closure.</p>
              <p id="Par62">The implant diameter should be smaller than the socket width, and the implant should be positioned palatally to ensure a minimum horizontal distance of 2 mm between the implant crest and the buccal bone to prevent buccal bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This causes a gap between the implant's cervical region and the bone tissue as well. Small gaps heal naturally without the need for repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], but it is recommended to use bone graft if the buccal gap is more than 2 mm horizontally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par63">Concentrated platelets have been utilized in wound healing in recent years due to their high growth factor concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A typical platelet concentration called PRF is made up of an autologous leukocyte-platelet-rich fibrin matrix with a three-dimensional structure that contains cytokines, platelets, and stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These cytokines have significant defense capacities against infections. The large amount of white blood cells has played an important role in anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial action during the process of immune regulation and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, few reports have been made about using PRF alone as a filling material for peri-implant bone defects.</p>
              <p id="Par64">Furthermore, PRF can be prepared with antibiotic loading, and the drug is subsequently released from PRF with an antimicrobial effect over four days which can be used after surgical procedures. More in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to prove that PRF loaded with antibiotics represents a topical antibiotic delivery tool for oral surgical procedures that promotes tissue healing and prevents local infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par65">Implant stability assessment was done using ISQ values of RFA, and there was no significant difference between the three groups at the time of implant placement (<italic>P</italic> = 0.114), at 6 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0119) and at 18 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.216). Primary implant stability was achieved by engaging the palatal wall and the bone approximately 2 mm beyond the apex of the extraction socket. There was a significant difference when comparing implant stability immediately postoperative and at different time intervals in the same group (P &lt; 0.001). This is due to secondary and tertiary stability establishment.</p>
              <p id="Par66">Po-Sung Fu et.al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported that an increase in the mean ISQ over time for all implants which were placed immediately with and without provisionalization Rowan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] found similar results in his study.</p>
              <p id="Par67">The measurement of the peri-implant pocket depth is (PPD) essential for diagnosing the periodontium. During assessment of PPD, there was no statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05) in all time intervals between the three groups. The peri-implant pocket depth's values were all within acceptable ranges (2.5–4 mm) in the three groups.</p>
              <p id="Par68">Our results were in line with that of Viswambaran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], whom found the PPD values increased from 6 to 12 months postoperative, but the values within the acceptable range.</p>
              <p id="Par69">In our study, an increase in PPD values can be attributable to reflection of a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap, which results in a junctional epithelium that is more apically positioned. In addition, open wounds heal slowly and with noticeable scarring because the peri-implant mucosa's vascular structure is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par70">A successful implant should have average bone loss of less than 1.5 mm over the first year after loading and less than 0.2 mm annually when measuring MBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. More buccal bone loss was observed in PRF group in comparison to other groups, this result indicates that augmenting the jumping gap with Xenograft or Alloplastic β-tricalcium phosphate led to a better coronal position of the alveolar bone crest than the PRF group. However, clinically PRF resulted in acceptable crestal bone levels which didn’t exceed 1.5 mm after the first year of implant placement.</p>
              <p id="Par71">Our results were in line with that of Elbrashy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], whom found that more crestal bone loss in a group grafted with PRF than a group grafted with bovine bone.</p>
              <p id="Par72">Regarding buccal bone thickness changes, more reduction in buccal bone thickness in PRF group in comparison to other groups.</p>
              <p id="Par73">These findings are in line with those of Nevins and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], who grafted fresh extraction sockets with deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) and noted that the buccal wall thickness of the grafted sites was slightly reduced in comparison to non-grafted sites. According to Sanz and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the reduction in the horizontal ridge's overall dimension was often less pronounced in grafted sites than it was in non-grafted ones.</p>
              <p id="Par74">This might be explained by the biology of various grafting materials and their rates of resorption. According to various studies, PRF can continue to release growth factors for up to 10 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] which is thought to be insufficient period of time to have an impact on the bone remodeling process following extraction and implant placement, which typically lasts for up to 6 months. On the other hand, Xenograft and Alloplastic β-tricalcium phosphate have slow resorption rate and provide a scaffold through which osteoblast cells can impregnate and regenerate bone in the jumping space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par75">The limitations of this study are a small sample size, a relatively short follow up period, and absence of a control group. In addition, soft tissue parameters such as keratinized mucosa width, gingival biotype, and gingival zenith position were not assessed.</p>

              <p id="Par76">This study demonstrated that the use of Xenograft and Alloplastic β-tricalcium phosphate as filling materials in conjunction with immediate implant have superior results regarding buccal bone loss and buccal bone thickness over use of PRF as a filling material.</p>
