                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Minimally invasive dentistry is a highly convenient and efficient method of managing caries in pediatric patients. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is commonly used to arrest active caries lesions. However, the associated black stain, possibility of soft tissue injury, and unpleasant taste often limit its use. Recently, nanosilver fluoride (NSF) emerged as a promising topical fluoride agent with potent cariostatic and antibacterial potentials. This novel anticaries agent has gained attention as an alternative to overcome the drawbacks of SDF in caries arrest.</p>

                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p id="Par2">To assess the antibacterial effect of NSF in relation to caries activity in dentin caries lesions, as well as to investigate the change in saliva bacterial levels in primary teeth in comparison to SDF after 1 and 3 months.</p>

                  <title>Materials and methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Fifty children aged 4 to 6 years old with active dentin caries lesions (score 5 according to International Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II) criteria) will be enrolled in the study. They will be equally and randomly allocated into 2 groups: a group receiving NSF and a control group receiving SDF treatment. Microbiological samples will be collected from the carious lesions and from unstimulated saliva at the baseline and at the 1 and 3 months’ follow-up appointments. Bacterial counts will be assessed using Mitis Salivarius agar (selective culture media for S. mutans) and Rogosa agar (selective culture media for lactobacilli), and the results will be expressed in colony-forming units. Data regarding the children’s oral health will be collected and their dmf index will be scored. The arrest of active carious lesions will be measured at the follow-up appointments according to ICDAS II criteria.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The relation between bacterial colony counts and lesion activity for both groups will be assessed, as well as the change in salivary bacterial counts. The collected data will be statistically evaluated and tabulated.

              <p id="Par5">Dental caries is a chronic disease, ranking among the most highly prevalent diseases in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Minimally invasive approaches to prevent and arrest caries lesions provide methods to address the caries problem that are affordable and convenient and do not require sophisticated equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has a proven antibacterial action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and assists enamel remineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and is available for arresting caries as a simple, non-invasive medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Its major drawback is the black staining of carious tissue and that it may induce reversible slightly painful lesions in the oral mucosa that usually disappear within 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, it has a reported unpleasant taste, and there are concerns about toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">The use of nanotechnology in dentistry has recently attracted significant attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], specifically, formulations of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Nanosilver fluoride (NSF) is a yellow solution containing uniformly dispersed AgNPs and fluoride. This new agent is safe to be used in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and has several desirable properties. Multiple in vitro researches have investigated the antimicrobial effects of AgNPs on carious tooth structures and have confirmed the substantial antibacterial effect of NSF on <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have reported that NSF is effective in arresting active dentine caries without any distinctive tissue pigmentation.</p>
              <p id="Par7">To our knowledge, no publication has reported the in vivo antimicrobial efficiency of NSF on the primary dentition in comparison to SDF. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate and compare the antibacterial and caries activity of NSF versus SDF in dentin caries lesions and saliva in primary teeth. Specifically, in active lesions have a distinct cavity with visibly exposed dentine, where the cavity feels soft or leathery on gentle probing (known as active score 5 ICDAS II lesions). The null hypothesis of this study is that no statistically significant difference will be detected between NSF and SDF by comparing their antibacterial effect in relation to caries activity in dentin caries lesions, as well as that there will be no statistically significant difference in the change in salivary bacterial levels after 1 and 3 months of follow-up.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], after 5 months, the NSF group had 72.7% arrested decay. Therefore, it was estimated that 14.54% of lesions treated with NSF will be arrested after 1 month. According to Milgrom et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], 51.7% of lesions treated with 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) have been arrested after 21 days. Based on difference between two independent proportions, the minimum sample size was calculated to be 24 patients per group, increased to 25 teeth to make up for lost to follow-up cases. Total sample size = number per group × number of groups = 25 × 2 = 50 patients.

As regards the change in microbiological analysis, it will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA or Freidman’s test, followed by the suitable post hoc test and as per your valuable recommendation the Bonferroni adjustment will be used. Regarding the change in caries activity, Cochran’s Q test will be used. Regression analysis will be used to assess the potential confounders such as gender, social status, and dietary habits. In order to include all randomized participants in the intention-to-treat analysis, multiple imputation will be performed to impute missing caries activity data and bacterial colony-forming unit log count using all caries indictor variables that will be measured and collected using the WHO questionnaire for oral health assessment of children, these include age, socio-economic status, fluoride exposure, sugar intake, and treatment group. The pooled data of five drawn imputations will be analyzed using Rubin’s rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to produce the adjusted estimates and statistics from which inferences will be drawn. The data will be graphically presented with suitable graphs. The level of statistical significance will be set at 5%. In the case of sample drop out and non-adherence, the intention-to-treat analysis will be employed to account for the missing outcome values in the follow-up appointments.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par65">The use of SDF has been greatly popularized in the last years after its FDA approval in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, due to the permanent unesthetic black stain and possibility of soft tissue injury, it is sometimes unacceptable to patients especially for the treatment of anterior teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Additionally, soft tissue burns have been reported after the use of SDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The incorporation of nanotechnology into modern pediatric dentistry may pave the way for a more efficient minimally invasive caries treatment. NSF is a promising cariostatic agent with a potent antibacterial activity and does not produce a black stain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Nanosilver particles have been widely used in a range of medical procedures ranging from treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], to medical device coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and wound dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The use of nanosilver products is continually increasing and their incorporation into the dental field holds a promising future. Especially, with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for effective minimally invasive dental treatments is of paramount importance. Many dental institutions are not adequately equipped to face the widely spreading virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and the implementation of non-aerosol generating dental procedures is of vital to limit the spread of the virus.</p>
              <p id="Par66">It is important to ensure that the nanosilver product in use is safe and poses no health risks as there have been some concerns related to the cytotoxicity of the nanosilver used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Previous clinical trials using NSF intraorally have synthesized AgNPs using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Sodium borohydride is known to be a highly toxic and corrosive chemical that is commonly used in bleaching wood, and its fumes are known to be odorless and cause severe irritation to the lungs and skin. Its use poses a recognized health hazard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. For the obvious safety concerns, an alternative method of nanosilver synthesis for clinical investigations would be more appropriate. Therefore, trisodium citrate—an FDA-approved salt widely used in personal and dental care products— [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] was used as a reducing agent instead of sodium borohydride. Additionally, the synthesized AgNPs were PEGylated to increase the stability of the nanosuspension and to prevent particle aggregation. Polyethylene glycol is a popular FDA-approved polymer used extensively as a pharmaceutical stabilizing agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Characterization tests and cytotoxicity assays are important to ensure the safety of the synthesized formulation for clinical use.</p>
              <p id="Par67">The determination of the suitability of nanosilver fluoride as an anticaries agent and as a valid alternative to SDF is a multifaceted feat. While previous studies have investigated its effect on caries activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and antibacterial potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], there still remains a lack in the knowledge surrounding its clinical performance as an antibacterial agent. This clinical trial aims to bridge the gap in the available literature on the clinical antibacterial effect of nanosilver fluoride in caries of the primary dentition.</p>

                <p id="Par68">This study protocol received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University (IORG 0008839 - IRB No. 0359-12/2021). A signed informed consent will be obtained by the principal investigator (NA) from every parent. The informed consent that will be signed by the parents will encompass the data to be collected and its intended analysis and use for the study purpose, and it will thoroughly explain the trial procedures, benefits, possible harms/risks, and outline the measures taken to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants. Additionally, the informed consent will include a picture of the black stain caused by SDF treatment. Carious teeth not treated with SDF or NSF, or those showing signs of failure after treatment, or new carious lesions that will appear during the follow-up period, will be appropriately treated. The voluntary nature of the study will be emphasized, and parents will be informed of their right to withdraw from the trial at any time without incurring any penalties.</p>

                <title>Data monitoring</title>
                <p id="Par69">The participants will be contacted by phone after 48 h of the intervention to monitor any reported adverse events or any other unintended effects; if more than half of the participants report adverse events, such as soft tissue injury or pain, the study will be terminated. Furthermore, an interim analysis of the change in microbiological count and lesion activity of the sampled lesions will be conducted at the 1-month follow-up appointment. The study will be terminated if the majority of the treated teeth show signs of continued caries lesion activity as defined by the International Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II). Active caries lesions will be detected by visual-tactile inspection to assess lesion severity and activity, where if the cavity is found to be shiny and feels hard on gentle probing of the dentin, it is considered an active lesion. Additionally, if the majority of the lesions show signs of caries progression and/or pulpal pathology, the study will be immediately terminated, and the participants will receive the needed restorative treatment. Emphasis will be made on the fact that participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time. No data monitoring committee (DMC) is available at the researcher’s institution and therefore no external body outside of the study team will monitor the data or have access to it.</p>
