                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Oral mucositis is one of the most emerging and debilitating complications of chemotherapy during the treatment period, which strongly affects the nutritional status and physical and mental condition of these patients. Zinc increased protein synthesis and improved cell membrane stability so passible effective in prevent and treat oral mucositis and promote oral health. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of zinc chloride mouthwash on the prevention, incidence, and severity of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The present study was a randomized control trial study. 96 patients with a cancer diagnosis selected from one oncology clinic in the west of Iran. Then they assigned randomly to the zinc chloride group and placebo group. The patients in each group should rinse their mouths every 8Â h two times and each time 2Â min with 7.5Â ml from mouthwash. The severity of mucositis and weight loss examined blindly at the baseline and 3-week follow-up.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The incidence and severity of oral mucositis between groups were significant higher at the end of the second (pâ&lt;â0.002) and third (pâ&lt;â0.001) week. The mucositis severity decreased well during the third weeks in the zinc chloride group. The difference in the weight loss was significant higher between the zinc chloride and the placebo group (pâ&lt;â0.01).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Zinc chloride mouthwash was effective in preventing and reducing the severity of oral mucositis and improving weight in patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
                  <p id="Par5"><italic>Trial registration</italic> We can therefore recommend more studies examine the effects zinc chloride as preventive care at the beginning of chemotherapy to improve oral health and subsequently preventing weight loss in these patients.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Cancer is one of the most horrible diseases of the century because it has affected more than 15 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. And, it has caused more than 7 million deaths annually in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Studies conducted in Iran show that over 112,000 people are diagnosed with breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach, and blood cancers, of which 54% are male and 46% of patients are female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The growing statistics of cancer in Iran caused the center for disease control and prevention to implement strategies with an emphasis on the three goals of prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment with the least side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this regard, one of the most important strategies is to provide effective treatment with the least side effects of care therapy, which emphasizes the importance of paying attention to choosing the appropriate treatment and providing efficient care by medical staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While chemotherapy is one of the most feasible treatments for patients with various types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but this treatment method causes many problems and side effects for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most significant and common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite, impaired body image and Oral mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Oral mucositis is severe, painful inflammation with multiple lesions of the oral. Mucositis appear from the fourth day of chemotherapy in 40 to 80% of patients undergoing chemotherapy that usually lasts 7 to 14Â days after chemotherapy and causes a lot of pain and discomfort in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Because these patients experience persistent and excruciating pain in the oral cavity when eating and even drinking fluids and talking, which severely affects their nutritional status, physical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], Consequently, their mental health and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, despite the high incidence of oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy, there is no available definitive treatment for mucositis, and only supportive cures were used to reduce pain associated with mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">The multinational association of supportive care in cancer (MASCC) has provided a guideline and appropriate recommendations for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients. This panel suggests that implementation of multi agent combination oral a care protocol is beneficial for the prevention of oral mucositis during chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, this has led to several studies in recent years trying to find a way to reduce the incidence and treatment of oral mucositis in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Yarom et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] stated zinc supplements orally effective in the prevention of oral mucositis in oral cancer patients receiving radiation therapy or chemo radiation. In this regard, some studies have investigated the effectiveness of zinc on oral mucositis in these patients, because zinc a vital role in promoting regeneration processes, cell membrane stability, and membrane wound healing by increasing protein synthesis and nucleic acid as well as improving oxygen transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although high consumption of zinc in some people might cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste, kidney and stomach damage, and other side effects, but zinc is safe when taking by mouth in doses 40Â mg daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, studies have used the safe dose of zinc to evaluate the effect of zinc on the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These studies have shown the effectiveness of zinc sulfate capsules in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Unfortunately, in these circumstances, zinc is mostly used in the form of zinc sulfate to treat oral mucositis, and due to severe nausea, patients undergoing chemotherapy are often reluctant to take zinc sulfate capsules and prefer to use mouthwashes over oral medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, there is no care to prevent oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and if oral mucositis develops in these patients, the doctor prescribes one of the mouthwash brands available in the market for them. However, in many cases, the financial condition of the cancer patient is not good, these conditions become more difficult and sometimes it is difficult to provide mouthwash, which is often expensive, for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Therefore, the researchers decided to study the effect of zinc chloride mouthwash on the prevention of incidence and severity of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy to achieve acceptable results to introduce an appropriate mouthwash to prevent and treat oral mucositis in these patients.</p>

Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed bottles with similar shape, color and size containing of zinc chloride mouthwash and placebo were used to conceal the allocation sequence and to maintain blinding and necessary measures were taken so that the sequence would remain concealed until the intervention was allocated to the intervention groups.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, mouthwashes for all patients of zinc chloride and placebo in this study were prepared by a pharmacist specializing in pharmaceutics in the clean room of Hamadan university of medical sciences. Mouthwash for the zinc chloride group containing zinc chloride 0.2%, greasy mint, preservative and mouthwash for the control group were similar to the intervention group but lacked effective material. All patients in two groups were educated in routine oral care (teeth brushing, proper nutrition, and mouth hygiene). The patients in each group should rinse their mouths every 8Â h two times and each time 2Â min with 7.5Â ml from mouthwash. The time interval between each mouthwash was 15Â min. Participants in the two groups rinsed their mouth so that the mouthwash covered the tongue, palate, throat, inside the cheeks, and all the tissues of the mouth well.</p>

This scale measures objective (redness, edema, and wound development) and subjective symptoms (dysphagia and mucosal severity). Accordingly, mucositis is classified to five levels (0â4). Asymptomatic (0); ulcers, redness in the mucous membranes of the mouth, gums, tongue, and palate is low (1); there are redness, inflammation, and multiple ulcers in the patientâs mouth, but they can eat solid food without pain (2); significant redness, inflammation and ulcers in the mouth and the ability to eat soft foods and liquids (3). Redness, inflammation and several ulcers in the mouth with pain and difficulty swallowing that make it impossible to eat food (4). This scale has content and face validity and internal reliability of 0.91 in Iranian society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par22">The results of the present study have revealed that zinc chloride mouthwashes are effective in preventing and treating oral mucositis during third week. In effect, 45 patients in the zinc chloride group and 25 patients in the placebo group did not show symptoms of oral mucositis within third week of starting the study. Additionally, the findings of this study showed that there was a statistically difference between the zinc chloride group with the placebo group in prevent and reduce the severity of oral mucositis. In addition, only three patients in the zinc chloride group with grade 2 and 3 oral mucositis did not improve within third week of follow-up. Based on this, It seems that zinc chloride mouthwash is effective in prevent oral mucositis and reducing the severity of oral mucosal in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In this regard, Elad et al. Stated the provision of medicinal compounds is essential for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, although Yarom et al.'s study showed oral zinc compounds have been effective in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in patients with oral cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but the effect of zinc sulfate mouthwash has not been studied on oral mucosa in these patients.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Consistent with the findings of this study, Rambod et al.'s study also states that zinc sulfate capsules also partially prevent the development of oral mucositis in patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy up to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, in this study, zinc chloride mouthwash reduced the incidence of oral mucositis much more. The possible reason for this difference could be the administration of zinc chloride mouthwash instead of zinc sulfate capsule and intervention only in patients with leukemia. In the present study, patients were followed up for 3Â week from the start of chemotherapy, while Rambod et al. did the Follow up for patients in 14Â days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. And because the risk of oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy increases over time, and since it can occur up to 21Â days after chemotherapy, follow-up of patients up to 3Â week and fewer incidences of oral mucositis in them compared to Rambod study may be due to using zinc glyceride mouthwash solution instead of zinc sulfate capsule. That is because most of these patients suffer from nausea, vomiting, and pain in swallowing the capsule is but using mouthwash is easier for them. Consistent with the findings of this study, other studies, despite using zinc sulfate capsules in the prevention of oral mucositis, they have shown that zinc can be efficient in preventing oral mucositis. In this regard, Ertekin et al. (2004) stated that zinc sulfate efficiently prevents oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy as it occurred in only 13 patients in the zinc sulfate pharyngeal mucosa group (grade 0â1â2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present study, the incidence of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy was three. This difference is probably due to differences in the type of cancer, treatment methods, and instruments in measuring oral mucositis. On the other hand, the findings of this study showed that zinc chloride mouthwash solution significantly reduces the severity of oral mucositis compared to the placebo group during three week. Consistent with the findings of this study, other studies have shown that zinc sulfate capsules significantly reduce the severity of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">In this regard, Rambod et al. state that the severity of oral mucositis in the zinc sulfate group is less mild, and there is a statistically significant difference with the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mehdipour et al. also state that the severity of oral mucosal pharynx in patients undergoing radiotherapy in the zinc sulfate group is less than placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Because zinc plays a vital role in promoting the body's physiological processes, including growth and development, immune system survival, cell membrane stability, and membrane wound healing by increasing protein synthesis and nucleic acid, as well as improving oxygen transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients under treatment, it can prevent tissue damage, including oral mucositis, by promoting the activity of immune cells, and even improve the repair process of tissue damage by increasing protein and nucleic acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the administration of drugs containing zinc, especially mouthwashes, due to easier administration, it can remarkably reduce the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In this study also, weight loss in patients in the intervention group was prevented well during 3Â weeks. Even the weight of patients in the zinc chloride group improved than placebo group. Although, some studies have examined the weight of patients with cancer, but few studies have examined the effect of herbal and chemical drugs on the oral mucositis and consequently its effect on weight in these patients. In this regard, the study of Toyomasu et al. showed that an amino acid diet is effective in treating oral mucositis and consequently is caused the body weight loss in the this group was smaller than that in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Also, Pathak et al. stated that significant weight loss during the treatment was seen in all patients of the control compared to the patients in the glutamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Arezoo Khanjani pour-fard-pachekenari et al. presented the difference in the weight was significant between the honey mouthwash and the control groups at the end of the third week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="Par27">One of the most significant limitations of the present study was the small sample size of the participants. Therefore, it is suggested that similar studies with greater sample size be conducted in the coming years to estimate the effects of chloride mouthwash on the incidence and severity of oral mucositis more precisely and cause oral health in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy subsequently. In addition, only patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy were studied in this study; therefore, due to the high nausea of ââthese patients, swallowing problems, and easier administration of mouthwash than a capsule, it is suggested to investigate the effect of zinc chloride mouthwash on the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Another limitation was evaluating only oral mucositis in this study; therefore, the evaluation of zinc chloride mouthwash on the incidence and severity of mucositis in other mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract could yield findings that are more valuable.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par28">Zinc chloride mouthwash in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy has properly promoted oral health and reduced the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in these patients from the start of chemotherapy until about three weeks later. Thus, Caregivers, especially nurses in chemotherapy wards can recommend zinc chloride as a therapeutic care measure for these patients to improve oral health and subsequently reduce the pain and suffering caused by the side effects of chemotherapy.</p>
