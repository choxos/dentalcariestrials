                  <p id="Par1">The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of ibuprofen versus diclofenac plus orphenadrine on postoperative pain in orthognathic surgery.</p>

                  <title>Material and methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Patients who underwent orthognathic surgery were randomized into two groups to receive intravenously either 600 mg of ibuprofen (I-group) or 75 mg diclofenac plus 30 mg orphenadrine (D-group), both of which were given twice daily. Additionally, both groups were given metamizole 500 mg. Rescue pain medication consisted of acetaminophen 1000 mg and piritramide 7.5 mg as needed. To assess the pain intensity, the primary end point was the numeric rating scale (NRS) recorded over the course of the hospital stay three times daily for 3 days.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">One hundred nine patients were enrolled (age range, 18 to 61 years) between May 2019 and November 2020. Forty-eight bilateral sagittal split osteotomies (BSSO) and 51 bimaxillary osteotomies (BIMAX) were performed. Surgical subgroup analysis found a significant higher mean NRS (2.73 vs.1.23) in the BIMAX D-group vs. I-group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015) on the third postoperative day. Additionally, as the patient’s body mass index (BMI) increased, the mean NRS (<italic>r</italic> = 0.517, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) also increased. No differences were found between age, gender, length of hospital stay, weight, operating times, number of patients with complete pain relief, acetaminophen or piritramide intake, and NRS values. No adverse events were observed.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The results of this study demonstrate that ibuprofen administration and lower BMI were associated with less pain for patients who underwent bimaxillary osteotomy on the third postoperative day. Therefore, surgeons may prefer ibuprofen for more effective pain relief after orthognathic surgery.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">Orthognathic surgery is a standard procedure in maxillofacial surgery. The current concept of correcting facial asymmetry dates back to the 1950s, when Obwegeser began introducing the idea of splitting the mandible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. What became known as the “bilateral sagittal split osteotomy” (BSSO) is now the dominating technique to set back a protruding or set forward a retruding lower jaw. In addition, BSSO can be combined with the Le Fort I osteotomy to correct midfacial deformities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These cosmetic and corrective surgical procedures are associated with extensive soft tissue damage and swelling that may cause moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par7">Acute intense pain is not uncommon following orthognathic surgery, and untreated may lead to undue suffering among patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, it is known that undermanaged pain results in delayed healing and recovery in the postoperative setting, which can furthermore interfere with patient’s daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. If pain control remains inadequate, a substantial proportion of patients continue to experience postsurgical pain and increased opioid consumption despite administration of multiple analgesics. Consequently, acute pain and its sequelae are the most common reason for hospitalization and emergency department visits following orthognathic surgery. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par8">Therefore, adequate pain management is vitally important to patient outcomes. Pain management is unique to each patient and dependent on multiple factors including the severity and temporality of the pain, as well as the patient’s physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Current management of mild-to-moderate pain utilizes nonopioids treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen. As with any medication, it is important to be aware of potential side effects, as for NSAIDS these include nausea, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly, acetaminophen is considered the safest analgetic agent but has a known hepatotoxic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Metamizole is another potential nonopioid alternative, but its use is controversial and requires a warning about the risk of agranulocytosis. As pain severity increases, opioids become the drug of choice but should be taken for the shortest amount of time necessary. Common side effects of opioids include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and use disorder which are well documented in the medical literature. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par9">The US opioid crisis of recent years refocused clinicians’ interest in utilizing the combined use of NSAIDs along with several other nonopioid analgesic agents such as acetaminophen. As a consequence, opioid analgesics are recommended only if NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac, ibuprofen) have proven ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Currently, clinical practice varies regarding the use of NSAIDs in combination with opioids for pain management in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent randomized controlled study that used intravenous single-dose IV ibuprofen for preventive analgesia in comparison to saline showed both a reduction of pain scores and opioid consumption. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Various studies have highlighted the need for additional evidence related to outcomes for the optimal pain management following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The present study is the first to compare ibuprofen vs. diclofenac plus orphenadrine in orthognathic surgery for the treatment of postoperative pain.</p>
              <p id="Par10">The aim of this study was to assess pain scores in individuals receiving either ibuprofen or diclofenac plus orphenadrine after orthognathic surgery.</p>

Additional surgical procedures were chin osteotomies. All patients stayed in the hospital for at least 3 days. Patients with surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) were discharged from the hospital after the latency period of 3 days, if they were able to activate the appliance (bone-borne or tooth-borne) to achieve adequate expansion (0.5 mm per day). Baseline measures, including personal data of all patients, demographic characteristics such as sex and age, and clinical data such as comorbidities, were collected. Data was obtained from both patients and their medical records.

Additionally, metamizole 1 g and piritramide 3.75 mg was given intravenously as needed.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Before incision, local anesthesia was administered (articaine 4% with epinephrine 1:100.000, Ultracaine; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA). Mepivacaine HCl 4% (Scandicaine; AstraZeneca, Wedel, Germany) was administered in case of articaine or epinephrine contraindications. One dose of systemic glucocorticoids (intravenous prednisolone 1 mg per kg per day) was administered during the operation.</p>
                <p id="Par17">BSSO was performed through a buccal osteotomy of the mandibular body. Medial ramus osteotomy started at the ridge and terminated just posterior to the lingual into the retrolingual fossa. Then the sagittal osteotomy was made through the buccal cortex of the mandibular ramus and body. Lingual and buccal cortical plates were separated. A splint was used, and the planned occlusion was secured with holding wires. Three screws were used for the rigid fixation through a transbuccal approach on each side.</p>
                <p id="Par18">For two jaw surgery, Le Fort I osteotomies were undertaken through a horizontal osteotomy line 5 mm above the root apices. The osteotomy was made from the pyriform rim to the posterior maxilla. After downfracture, the maxilla was passively repositioned using an interim splint and holding wires. Internal fixation was then applied with four plates, and the interim splint was removed. Then BSSO was performed as described above. Elastics were routinely applied to all patients for 2 weeks.</p>

The maximum daily adult dose of ibuprofen (Ibuprofen B. Braun 600 mg) is 1200 mg and of diclofenac 150 mg (Neodolpasse® Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH) for intravenous application respecting the instructions given by the manufacturers and the anesthesiologist at the Medical University of Graz. From the fourth postoperative day until discharge, oral analgesics (either ibuprofen 600 mg or diclofenac 50 mg twice per day respectively) were administered without change to treatment arm.. For better pain relief, all patients received metamizole 500 mg three times per day. Rescue medication consisted of acetaminophen 1000 mg up to three times a day. If patients had not experienced sufficient pain relief, piritramide 7.5 mg was administered as needed up to four times a day. Investigational medication was not blinded. Participants in both groups were instructed to use local ice application. Moreover, a liquid diet was introduced after surgery.</p>

The first reported NRS scores were recorded 4 h after surgery on postoperative day (POD) 0. NRS scores for POD 1–3 are reported, considering three scores were measured throughout each postoperative day, and only 1 score is reported per POD; thus, the scores were averaged across each POD. Additionally, a 24 h NRS ≤ 1 is defined as a period without pain or close to no pain for 24 h.</p>

              <p id="Par41">Orthognathic surgery addresses both esthetic and functional problems by mobilizing the mandible and/ or the maxilla, which unfortunately can lead to substantially increased morbidity due to postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Modern pain management strategies build on opioids, steroids, nonpharmacologic methods, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Following orthognathic surgery, NSAIDs are the most commonly prescribed medication for postoperative pain medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; however, the lack of evidence regarding pain management in oral and maxillofacial surgery results in wide variations in analgesic practice.

              <p id="Par42">Of importance, a consensus has emerged in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy regarding diclofenac, noting it has the potential for higher rates of cardiovascular side effects. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] The European Medical Agency has released two Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommendations on diclofenac (2013) and ibuprofen (2016) to increase awareness of potential cardio- or cerebrovascular side effects while still confirming that both drugs are valuable analgesics in the appropriate patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Interestingly, to date, no studies have reported the supplemental use of metamizole in orthognathic surgery. This could in part be due to the drug’s safety profile. While metamizole is an effective analgesic and is broadly used in many European countries, it possesses a varying risk of fatal agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, there is still considerable controversy surrounding its use. In the present study, the authors found no adverse events from metamizole.

Initially, it was expected that patient who received diclofenac plus orphenadrine would have a higher incidence for serious medication-related adverse events. However, no serious adverse events from pain medication occurred in the present study population (<italic>n</italic> = 109). Our assumption was that this patients are of relatively young age and therefore are less prone to cardiovascular problems. Definitely, the question of whether certain NSAIDs have advantages over others has not been settled yet.</p>

The potential association of postoperative swelling and pain remains unclear.

Interestingly, three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry showed patients with a higher BMI had the greatest amount of swelling. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par46">Secondary outcomes did not generally favor ibuprofen over diclofenac plus orphenadrine; however, an association of high BMI and high NRS scores was found in both groups. In addition, the results of this study are in agreement with previous research which has found no significant between groups with respect to age, gender, weight, and duration of operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, the present study showed an association between higher BMI and pain intensity across all patients.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Moreover, the present study investigated the patient-centered use of opioids, since NSAIDs are known to have an opioid sparing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The opioid consumption was not significantly different between the groups. Although patients who receive opioids carry the risk of overdose and use disorder, opioids are often necessary for adequate analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The potential importance of opioids is supported by previous observations, with the combination of opioids and NSAIDs being the best treatment for acute postoperative pain in maxillofacial surgery. Therefore, brief opioid courses rather than NSAIDs alone are the preferred therapy for severe pain. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par48">The patient discharge decisions may be complex and complications are not predictable. Improving quality of care and simultaneously lowering costs are challenges for the healthcare system in addition to preventing unnecessary readmissions. At the investigators’ institution, patients were kept for at least 3 days in the hospital. The mean LOS for all procedures was 6.18 days (range 4 to 9 days), which falls within the range of 1.7 to 20.0 days reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Different global discharge patterns were attributed to different management practices, insurance coverage, infrastructure (large-bed vs. small-bed hospitals, outpatient nursing facilities), quality of care, and hospital characteristics (teaching vs. nonteaching hospitals).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>Several limitations must be acknowledged, including the fact that study group assignment did not undergo block or stratified randomization; thus, selection bias cannot be ruled out. In addition, a placebo group was not included to compare the study regimen due to ethical concerns about administering placebo in patients with acute severe pain. The postoperative swelling was not quantified, likely to be greater in patients with bimaxillary osteotomies. Additionally, the study did not provide information on the anti-edema activity of steroids on postoperative pain. Given the young study population and lack of comorbidities, the study results may not be generalizable to patients with coexisting conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and older patients (&gt; 60 years of age).</p>
              <p id="Par49">The present study demonstrated that ibuprofen is more effective than diclofenac plus orphenadrine in bimaxillary cases providing greater postoperative pain relief. Additionally, the study found increased BMI is associated with higher pain scores following bimaxillary surgery, yet, age, gender, and operating time did not significantly impact postoperative pain.</p>
