                  <p id="Par3">Thirty-two class II malocclusion patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups. One group was treated with infrazygomatic (IZC) miniscrew- anchored CMA (IZCG) and the other group treated with Essix retainer- anchored CMA (EXG).

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par11">One of the most frequent treatment challenges is Class II malocclusion, which accounts for almost a third of all malocclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Carriere Motion appliance (CMA), (Henry Schein Orthodontics, CA, USA) was unveiled in 2004. By distalizing the entire maxillary buccal segment using class II elastics and mandibular anchors, CMA was designed to treat Class II molar relationship. The lingual arch, Essix retainer, or miniscrews are used as methods of anchorage to prevent protrusion of the mandibular incisors when the appliance is activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The application of the CMA has been assessed in former case reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One retrospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] compared the use of CMA with full fixed orthodontic appliances in the mandibular arch vs. a lingual arch anchorage and found that both techniques caused lower incisors proclination. Other investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] assessed the treatment by CMA anchored with Essix appliance and reported that the lower first molar moved and tipped mesially significantly with lower incisor proclination. Only one randomized clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (RCT) compared anchorage control using interdental miniscrews vs. Essix appliance and found that miniscrews reduced anchorage loss regarding the mandibular incisors.</p>
              <p id="Par13">The success of CMA, like that of the majority of orthodontic appliances, depends on the patient's commitment to intermaxillary elastics and lower retainer wear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has the adverse consequences of class II elastics, such as proclination of the lower incisors and maxillary canine extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To avoid the negative effects of CMA with class II elastics, we can employ the CMA to distalize the maxillary buccal segment with intra-arch anchorage utilizing IZC miniscrews noting that they are contraindicated in cases of compromised immune defense, bleeding disorders, pathological bone quality, or inadequate oral hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and in children with deciduous or mixed dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">To our knowledge, few studies have examined the effects of the CMA three-dimensionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, these assessments used cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT), which is not considered as a routine diagnostic tool owing to its high radiation exposure. Remarkably, only two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have utilized models to examine the 3D effects of the CMA.</p>

                <p id="Par15">The objective of this study was to compare the 3D effects of IZC miniscrew anchored vs. Essix anchored CMA for distalization of the maxillary buccal segment using laterals cephalograms and digitized models.</p>

                <p id="Par23">The right size of CMA was selected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Then it was bonded to the upper canine and first molar.</p>
                <p id="Par24">In IZCG: two miniscrews (Bio-ray, New Taipei, Taiwan), 14 mm long and 2 mm in diameter, were placed in infrazygomatic crest area bilaterally and a closing coil spring was affixed bilaterally between the maxillary canine and the IZC miniscrews as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intraoral photos of a case in IZCG; <bold>A</bold> predistalization, <bold>B </bold>Intervention, <bold>C</bold> postdistalization photos</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2024_3925_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par25">In EXG: After bonding buccal tubes to the lower first molars and taking an impression of the lower arch, a cast was made. The Essix appliance was made from a vacuum sheet of 1.5 mm thickness with a window around the buccal tubes for class II elastic attachment bilaterally as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Heavy 1/4-inch elastics were utilized for the first month followed by heavy 3/16-inch elastics. Except during mealtimes, participants were told to wear the elastics day and night and to replace them every day.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intraoral photos of a case in EXG; <bold>A</bold> predistalization, <bold>B</bold> Intervention, <bold>C</bold> postdistalization photos</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2024_3925_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par26">Every four weeks, follow-up appointments were planned, and the appliance was debonded in both groups on reaching Class I relationship. Two lateral cephalograms were taken and two impressions for both upper and lower arches were obtained immediately before intervention and after completing distalization before starting the second phase of the treatment. Casts were made and scanned for obtaining digital models.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par27">The primary outcomes were the treatment duration, skeletal and dental changes. A single, blinded assessor compared the de-identified cephalograms and the 3D digital models. The cephalograms were assessed using WebCeph (web-based program for cephalometric analysis). Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the skeletal and dental measurements. The 3D model images were assessed using 3D measurements tool in OrthoAnalyzer software (3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) after model preparation and plane alignment by setting up the occlusal plane, the sagittal plane; MV line (A vertical reference plane drawn through the median palatine suture from the incisive papilla, perpendicular to the occlusal plane) and the coronal plane; MH line (the horizontal reference line passing through the left third rugae and perpendicular to MV). The model landmarks and measurements are described in detail in Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>(A-F).

              <p id="Par40">The idea of CMA is to distalize the entire posterior maxillary segment using class II elastics and mandibular anchoring, correcting Class II molar relationship. No previous RCT evaluated CMA compared to IZC- anchored one. So, the aim of this RCT was to compare distalization of the maxillary buccal segment using skeletaly anchored CMA vs. conventionally anchored CMA.</p>
              <p id="Par41">There are few studies which analyzed the 3D effects of the CMA using CBCT, which is not a routine orthodontic record owing to the excess radiation exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, there are few studies that used models to study the 3D effects of the CMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since this study is one in a few investigations of digital models, only the results of the cephalometric radiographs are comparable to other studies.</p>

                <p id="Par42">The CMA corrected the molar relation class II in average duration of 6.3 and 5.9 months in IZCG and EXG respectively with insignificant difference between the two groups. The average distalization time of both groups was similar to that found in Yin et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (6.3 months), but longer than that found in other researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This might be because the majority of the participants in this study were older with higher bone densities. However, compared to skeletal anchorage distalization appliances and conventional ones, the distalization period was shorter (8.2 and 8 months, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par43">In IZCG, there were insignificant skeletal sagittal and vertical changes. This is consistent with the majority of publications which claimed that intraoral maxillary distalizers only had slight indirect skeletal effects with direct dentoalveolar changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While in EXG, there was significant sagittal changes. These findings in EXG were similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

                <p id="Par44">In EXG, there was a significant increase in the lower incisor proclination (3.5° ± 1.3) and the lower first molar moved mesial with significant mesial tipping and significant extrusion. On the other hand, these findings were not found in IZCG because no class II elastics were used. The horizontal and vertical components of the forces exerted by class II elastics explain the mesialization and extrusion of the lower molars in EXG denoting that molar class II correction is an integration of mandibular molar mesialization and maxillary molar distalization. Transferring the anchorage control in the mandibular arch to the maxillary one by using IZC miniscrews aided in correcting class II molar relation by maxillary distalization only without affecting the lower arch. Despite the fact that Fouda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] used miniscrews in the lower arch, they did not prevent the mesial movement of lower second molar. Different studies also found significant mesial movement, tipping, and extrusion of lower first molars with CMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

                <p id="Par45">Maxillary canine and first molar were significantly distalized by -3.1 ± 0.9, and 3.2 ± 1.2 mm respectively in IZCG. While in EXG, they were significantly distalized by -2.3 ± 0.7 and 2.2 ± 0.8 mm respectively. The extent of distalization was significantly higher in IZCG compared to EXG. The amount of distalization of upper first molar was comparable to that reported in earlier research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The distalization of the entire maxillary buccal segment by CMA means that there was no anchorage loss in the premolar area unlike other distalizers that required retraction of the premolars and canines after molar distalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

So, it can be said that the ball-and-socket joint partially reduced molar tipping but did not eliminate it entirely as claimed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Distal tipping of the upper molars was also reported in some other previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, distal tipping of the upper canine was detected in some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which is against the claims that the CMA's front section is a rigid half-round arm that controls the canine's inclination permitting bodily movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par47">The significant intrusion of upper canine and first molar in IZCG and the significant extrusion of them in EXG can be attributed to the vertical force component of the Class II elastics in EXG which is the opposite in IZCG. Regarding the upper canine extrusion, some earlier studies showed similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regarding the upper first molar extrusion, a former study showed similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">The significant rotation of upper canine and upper first molar in both IZCG and EXG is due to the ball and socket joint in the molar pad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, CMA corrected Class II partially by distal derotation with distalization of the maxillary first molars. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] also proved upper molar and canine rotation but using CBCT.</p>
                <p id="Par49">The upper incisor inclination decreased more significantly in IZCG than in EXG. So, unlike other distalizers, CMA did not cause anchorage loss in the maxillary anterior segment. This decrease could be due to the spontaneous movement of the incisors in the space created by the distalization. However, some other studies found a slight proclination of the maxillary incisors resulting from the proclination of lower incisors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast, other earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] noted that CMA did not affect the maxillary incisors because CMA distalized the maxillary buccal segment without being attached to the maxillary incisors.</p>
                <p id="Par50">The overjet decreased significantly in both IZCG and EXG by 1.6 ± 1 and 1.4 ± 0.9 mm respectively. But the change between the two groups was not statistically different. In IZCG the decrease in overjet can be due to the spontaneous distal movement of incisors into the space created after the distalization of the buccal segment. In EXG, the overjet was notably reduced by mandibular incisors proclination like what was found in former studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p>
                <p id="Par51">In IZCG there was no significant change in the overbite. On the other hand, in EXG the overbite decreased significantly because class II elastics caused extrusion of lower first molars and upper first molars, distal tipping of upper molars and flaring of the lower incisors. In earlier research, CMA also significantly decreased the overbite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p>
                <p id="Par52">There was a more significant increase in the ICW in IZCG than EXG. While IMW increased only in IZCG. Hermann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported nearly no differences in anterior and posterior dental arch width and intercanine distance before and after CMA. However, they found little buccal movement of the canine and first molar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par55">IZC anchored CMA resulted in a more significant distalization of the maxillary buccal segment than the Essix anchored one with no significant difference between them regarding the duration of distalization. However, it was not bodily distalization, due to the significant molar rotation. IZC anchored CMA eliminated the negative effects of class II elastics on lower incisor inclination, mesial movement, tipping, and extrusion of lower molars, with no significant effect on the lower face height indicating that transferring the anchorage to the maxillary arch by using IZC miniscrews could correct class II malocclusion by only distalization without any effect on the lower arch.</p>
