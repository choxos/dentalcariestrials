                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients were randomized to CAD/CAM or conventional FRs in both arches, in 1:1 ratio and blocks of four. Allocation concealment was secured by using sequentially numbered envelopes. Patients were blinded. Retainers were bonded at the end of orthodontic treatment (T0), and patients were recalled after 1 (T1), 3 (T3), and 6 (T6) months. First-time retainer failures were recorded and digital impressions were taken. Arch widths and lengths, as well as Littleâs Irregularity Index (LII), were measured. Additionally, patients answered satisfaction questionnaires. Linear mixed models were applied for measurements and patient satisfaction. Survival analyses were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, along with Cox-regression modelling.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>One hundred and eighty-one patients were randomized (98 in Centre 1, and 83 in Centre 2): Ninety in the CAD/CAM group and 91 in the conventional group. Three subjects dropped out at baseline, as they did not attend any of the follow-up appointments.168 patients attended the T6 visit. There were no significant differences in arch dimensions between T0 and T6, whilst the LII was different only in the CAD/CAM group (mean difference: 0.2 mm; 95% confidence interval: 0.1 to 0.4; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Within 6 months, 39 upper retainers (19 out of 88 CAD/CAM and 20 out of 90 conventional retainers) and 52 lower retainers failed (26 out of 88 CAD/CAM and 26 out of 90 conventional retainers), with no significant difference between the survival of both types of retainers (hazard ratios conventional to CAD/CAM: upper arch: 0.99 [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> =0.99], lower arch: 0.93 [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.80]). There were no significant changes in patient satisfaction between the groups. No harms were observed.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Retention after orthodontic treatment is considered mandatory to maintain the stability of treatment outcome (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nevertheless, retention remains one of the most challenging areas in orthodontics. A Cochrane systematic review concluded in 2016 that there is insufficient evidence to favour one retention method over another in terms of post-treatment stability, harms, long-term implications, and patient satisfaction (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, more recently, in 2019, a Dutch team has developed a clinical practice guideline for retention (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Retention protocols are constantly refined to improve their effectiveness. Nevertheless, both fixed and removable retainers continue to be the trend (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). There is a marked geographical variation with the use of retention protocols. In the Netherlands, in 2009, fixed retainers (FRs) were reported to be the most common retainers (97%) and were used for both arches (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Seventy percent of patients had canine-to-canine FRs in the lower arch, and 34% in the upper arch. In 2018, a Dutch study reported that the most used retention protocol in the upper arch was a combination of FR and removable retainer (54%) and mainly a FR in the lower arch (83%) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A similar trend was observed in Norway (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). By contrast, in Australia and New Zealand, mandibular fixed and maxillary vacuum-formed retainers (VFRs) are the most prevalent combination (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the literature, a wide variety of FR protocols are used, which differ significantly in terms of wires/materials used, bonding technique and teeth involved (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). FRs have shown to be efficient, reliable, and to offer good short-term stability (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, besides the benefits, the use of these devices is associated with potential drawbacks and harms, such as failure associated with relapse and risk of undesirable adverse effects (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11â14</xref>). Moreover, FRs can impair the patientâs comfort and ability to maintain oral hygiene. Ideally, FRs should be flexible enough to allow some degree of physiologic movement of the retained teeth, hence, providing homeostasis to the periodontium as well as reducing tension within the composite bonding material (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, an ideal FR should not be susceptible to fracture and plaque retention.</p>
              <p>To limit the negative aspects of conventional retainers, advances in material science and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology have made it possible to generate innovative custom-cut nitinol FRs (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). CAD/CAM FRs are considered a potential alternative to conventional multistranded (MS) FRs, and are claimed to deliver utmost accuracy, and to reduce chair-time and need for operator dexterity (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, they seem to offer high predictability when limited bonding surface is available, as well as in anatomically demanding regions (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, CAD/CAM FRs might provide a very accurate passive fitting to the lingual tooth surface, which is critical as wire tension produced during bonding procedure can result in undesirable adverse effects over the long term, such as unexpected post-treatment tooth movements; unrelated to the initial malocclusion, caused by residual stress between the bonding points (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20â22</xref>). The clinical effectiveness of CAD/CAM FRs has not been tested extensively. Three recent prospective studies found no significant differences between CAD/CAM and MS FRs in terms of stability and failure rate (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23â25</xref>). However, those studies are characterized by relatively small samples.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing stability, failure rate and patient satisfaction of CAD/CAM retainers vs. conventional MS retainers in both arches, and is also one of the largest RCTs about FRs in general. The present report focuses on the preliminary results of this trial, that is, 6 months after retainer placement.</p>
              <sec id="s7">
                <title>Objectives and hypotheses</title>
                <p>The aims of the present RCT were to assess and compare the clinical effectiveness of CAD/CAM versus conventional MS FRs in terms of post-treatment stability (primary outcome), failure rate, and patient satisfaction (secondary outcomes) over a 6-month period. The null hypothesis was that CAD/CAM FRs present no significant differences when compared with MS FRs in terms of stability, failure rate, and patient satisfaction.</p>

For each failure, the affected teeth were recorded. Participants were advised to contact the clinic as soon as possible if they encountered any problems or concerns.</p>

The date of failure was reported as the day the patient became aware of the problem or alternatively the date the clinician noted the failure when a participant was unaware of the failure.

For arch dimensions and LII, each individual measurement was modelled by a linear mixed model with an unstructured marginal covariance pattern to induce correlation between two repeated measures on the same subject (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier curves separately for the upper and lower retainers, along with a Cox-regression modelling with Breslow method for ties to assess predictors for retainer survival. VAS results were adjusted for age, gender, randomization group, and time, in addition to modelling by a linear mixed regression model, but with two repeated measures on the same subject. All linear mixed models included a Kenward-Roger adjustment for the denominator degrees of freedom. For example, if five outcomes were being modelled, the individual significance level for each outcome was revised down to 1%.</p>

                <p>To evaluate inter-examiner reliability, two operators (AG and HP) measured 60 randomly selected models. The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess reliability. Twenty-six patients answered the same VAS again at a 1-week interval after T1. Test-retest reliability of the VAS results was assessed using ICC, computed by a linear mixed model for components of variance, also with a Kenward-Roger adjustment for denominator degrees of freedom.</p>

                <title>Secondary outcome: failures</title>
                <p>Within 6 months, in the upper arch, 19 out of 88 CAD/CAM retainers (22%) and 20 out of 90 conventional retainers (22%) failed (total upper failures: 39), whilst in the lower arch 26 out of 88 (30%) CAD/CAM retainers and 26 out of 90 (29%) conventional retainers failed (total lower failures: 52). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two groups. The hazard ratios are reported in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for both groups are presented in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. The distribution of the upper and lower first-time failure patterns in each group are illustrated in <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Bond failure was the most common pattern of failure in both groups and both arches, in particular at the enamel-composite interface. The distribution of failures per tooth is shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Lower central incisors (tooth 41) were the most prone to debondings. Out of the 13 patients who did not attend the 6-month visit, three did not attend any of the follow-up appointments, four had already encountered a failure event at an earlier retention follow-up (one CAD/CAM [in the lower jaw only] and three conventional [two in the upper jaw and one in both jaws]). The remaining six patients (three CAD/CAM and three conventional) were event-free at their 3-month visit.</p>

              <p>Post-treatment stability, survival, and patient satisfaction are parameters that a clinician must consider when choosing a retention protocol. To our knowledge, the present RCT is the largest one to compare stability, failure rate, and patient satisfaction of CAD/CAM versus conventional FRs in both upper and lower arches. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in arch dimensions, failure rate, and patient satisfaction between CAD/CAM and conventional FRs at 6-month post-treatment. Those findings seem to validate the use of CAD/CAM FRs since they perform equally well compared to conventional MS FRs, which used to be the gold standard (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>As it is believed that the stability of the lower arch is limited and that this arch is the key to stability or relapse as the upper arch wraps around the lower and follows changes in the lower arch alignment (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), many studies investigate FRs in the lower arch only. Alrawas <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. performed an RCT that compared CAD/CAM FRs with conventional MS FRs in terms of stability, with a protocol that included the lower arch only (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The sample size (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 60) was smaller than in the present study (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is known that FRs allow for good preservation of the inter-canine distance in the short-term (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The results of the present study are aligned with these findings. Furthermore, Forde et al. reported no difference in stability when comparing FRs with VFRs (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Regarding CAD/CAM technology, Alrawas <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. found no statistical significance in terms of stability between 0.012 Ã 0.018-inch CAD/CAM FRs (Robofix, Istanbul, Turkey) and 0.017-inch MS conventional FRs, which is, once again, in agreement with the present findings (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In the present study, a statistically significant difference in LII was observed between bonding and 6-month follow-up for the CAD/CAM retainers, however, this difference seems not to be clinically relevant (0.2 mm).</p>
              <p>Unexpected post-treatment changes are defined as dental changes that occur in terms of torque and/or rotational movements not related to the initial malocclusion (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Since MS wires are suspected to be responsible for those movements (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), one may hypothesize that a by definition fully passive CAD/CAM FR could be less subject to such side effects. In the present sample, after 6 months follow-up, no unexpected post-treatment changes were observed, in none of the groups, which was expected as those kinds of changes generally occur later (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
              <p>A large number of studies have investigated survival time of FRs, but mostly for the lower arch (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34â36</xref>). In the present study, the failure rate in the upper arch was 22% for both types of FRs, whereas, in the lower arch, the failure rate was 30% for the CAD/CAM FRs and 29% for the conventional FRs. For the ten patients who did not attend the 6-month visit but still attended one of the retention visits (i.e. T1 and/or T3), the status (failure or no failure) observed at their last visit was taken into consideration. Another assumption considering all retainers of those patients as failures would still result in no difference between the two groups (23 out of 88 CAD/CAM retainers (26%) and 23 out of 90 conventional retainers (26%), 29 out of 88 (33%) CAD/CAM retainers and 31 out of 90 (34%) conventional retainers).</p>
              <p>Failure of FRs is a common clinical complication. Bond failure in metal FRs is reported to be between 3.5% and 53% (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The failure rate for canine-to-canine FRs (0.0215 inch) has been reported to be as high as 53% (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), which is higher than the failure rates observed in the present study. The present findings indicate that the failure rates were similar for CAD/CAM and conventional FRs. Likewise, Alrawas <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. reported no statistical significance in failure rate between CAD/CAM FRs and conventional MS FRs after 6 months (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Another recent prospective study with 6 months follow-up concluded that lower FRs using Memotain (77% survival rate) and five-stranded wires (73% survival rate) were similar in terms of survival rates after 6 months follow-up (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <p>The present study reported lower failure rates for upper FRs compared to lower FRs. By contrast, Forde <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). reported much higher failures rates at 12 months follow up of upper versus lower MS FRs (64% and 50%, respectively).</p>
              <p>FRs may fail at the wire-composite interface, at the composite-enamel interface or can be subject to stress fracture of the wire at the inter-proximal areas, which can result in tooth displacement (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Bond failure, in particular at the enamel-composite interface, was the most common pattern of failure in both groups and in both arches in the present study. Gelin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, comparing CAD/CAM FRs to conventional FRs in a considerably smaller sample (62 subjects), reported no FR fractures, and observed a similar proportion of wire-composite and enamel-composite debondings with CAD/CAM FRs compared to conventional FRs (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Two other studies comparing CAD/CAM FRs to conventional FRs did not report failure patterns (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). One recent RCT (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) assessed failure rate in the lower arch only and reported lower failure rates of MS FRs (31%) when compared with fibre reinforced composite retainers.</p>
              <p>Some studies have reported the attitudes and preferences of orthodontists towards various retention protocols, but only few have explored patient satisfaction (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Scribante <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. investigated patient satisfaction for FRs in the lower arch and found that in terms of aesthetics, polyethylene ribbon-reinforced resin FRs were favoured more than MS FRs (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). On the other hand, Forde <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported that patients found VFRs easier to clean than FRs (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the present study, there was no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction between CAD/CAM and conventional FRs, except for the question âHow comfortable is it to clean your teeth together with your FRs?â, which showed an estimated difference of 5.2% in favour of CAD/CAM FRs. Gelin <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. found no difference in overall satisfaction and level of discomfort for the tongue with CAD/CAM versus conventional FRS, but did not investigate cleaning issues.</p>
              <p>This paper covers preliminary results of an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial. At the present stage, an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was not performed for the assessment of stability, as attrition was minimal (8.8%). An ITT analysis will be performed in the future reports of this RCT, if attrition becomes more severe.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>In the present study, the CAD/CAM Nitinol Memotain<sup>Â®</sup> 1.0 FRs were used. After the present study was initiated, an optimized version was introduced, Memotain<sup>Â®</sup> 2.0, which is âserrated to overcome the sliding effect, designed to fit better at the interdental areas and is assumed to have minimum risk of fractureâ, according to the manufacturer. Thus, the present study could not assess if Memotain<sup>Â®</sup> 2.0 would offer better retention to the tooth surface, thus leading to lower failure rate, specifically at the enamel-composite interface, which was the most common failure pattern in the present study, or if it would reduce composite wear.</p>
                <p>Although new technology is appealing, present drawbacks of CAD/CAM retainers are cost, and dependency on an external laboratory for laser cutting technology, potentially generating long waiting times between ordering and receiving FRs, with potential risk of tooth movement.</p>
                <p>This study was powered on a continuous outcome (LII), which usually requires a lower sample size than outcomes of binary nature such as rates. Hence, one should be aware that the secondary outcomes of binary nature, like satisfaction or failure rate, have a lower statistical power than that of the primary outcome.</p>
                <p>Patients were given an upper removable retainer after debonding and were advised to use at night-time, as dual retention is a relatively standard procedure for the maxilla in Denmark and Norway. This could have influenced the upper arch stability; however, it is known that upper anterior alignment is similarly stable with FRs combined to removable retainers, compared to FRs only (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Furthermore, it is not possible to know how consistently the patients were wearing their removable retainers.</p>
                <p>Finally, as previously mentioned, this report describes the preliminary results of an ongoing study. The 6-month follow-up results reported here only represent short-term retention outcomes.</p>

                <title>Generalizability</title>
                <p>One experienced operator at each centre bonded all retainers, which is a strength of the present study. However, this might not reflect the variability of a larger group of clinicians.</p>

                  <p>There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in arch dimensions, failure rate, and patient satisfaction between CAD/CAM Nitinol and MS conventional FRs in the upper and lower arches over a duration of 6 months post-treatment. In the CAD/CAM group, the LII increased statistically, but not clinically significantly over the 6-month follow-up.</p>
