                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is painful oral ulceration frequently treated with topical steroids. There is limited published evidence for the efficacy of any treatment for RAS and there remains a need for longitudinal randomised clinical trials to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different therapies in the management of RAS. The aim of the current project was to assess the efficacy of betamethasone mouthwash and colchicine tablets, individually and combined, for the treatment of RAS, and to establish the optimum treatment period necessary for a significant reduction in the disease severity.</p>

                  <title>Methodology</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A randomised, prospective, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted over one year, to compare the efficacy of three therapies in RAS. One hundred and six patients were randomized into three groups; 35 received betamethasone mouthwash, 35 had colchicine tablets and 36 received both therapies. The response was evaluated quantitatively every 3 months for 1 year, using the Ulcer Severity Score (USS).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">For all three treatment regimes, the mean USS decreased by about 30% in the first 3 months (p &lt; 0.001). Further improvement was noted for up to 9 months. At the end of the study, the mean USS had improved by 50% from 34.9 ± 7.2 before treatment to 17.5 ± 8.9 after treatment (p &lt; 0.001). Of included participants, 86% showed significant clinical improvement by the end of the study. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the three regimes (p &lt; 0.05).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This clinical trial has provided evidence for the efficacy of betamethasone mouthwash and for colchicine tablets in the treatment of RAS and has shown that at least six months of treatment may be required for optimum effect.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par7">Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is a relatively common oral mucosal condition affecting about 10% of the population with a varied reported prevalence of 1.5-25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. RAS is a chronic condition that usually starts in teenage years, with various degrees of severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite vast clinical experience in managing this condition, there is little clinical evidence supporting current therapies, which remain largely palliative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of RAS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In specialised oral medicine clinics in the UK, betamethasone sodium phosphate mouthwash, a steroid used to treat other conditions such as Rheumatic Diseases, is used (off licence) as the first line treatment for RAS, but there is limited published evidence for its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for longitudinal randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of betamethasone mouthwash for the management of RAS, and for comparison with other treatment regimes.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Colchicine, is an anti-inflammatory agent with some immunosuppressive action, used for treating gout and other conditions including PFAPA syndrome and Behçet’s Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Colchicine therapy has been used in specialised clinics for the more severe cases of RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but systematic reviews have concluded that further clinical trials are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some studies have supported the efficacy and safety of colchicine for controlling RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but none were formal comparisons with other treatment modalities.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Evidence based clinical research requires disease severity assessment and outcome measures. In recent years, oral disease severity scoring systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], including ulcer severity scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], provided tools for this assessment, and their use in trials is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The aims of the current study were to provide clinical evidence for the efficacy of betamethasone mouthwash in the treatment of RAS and to compare it to the efficacy of systemic colchicine, and that of dual therapy of both betamethasone and colchicine. A secondary aim was to determine the optimal duration of treatment to achieve a significant reduction in the ulcer severity score (USS). Previous studies have indicated that a USS of 20 or less could be classified as mild and that this was a threshold for deciding whether active treatment of any kind was warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The therapy regimes study used in this study were according to the routine clinical practice in our oral medicine clinics for the management of RAS.</p>

              <title>Study design</title>
              <p id="Par11">A randomised, prospective, parallel-group, single-centre clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of three different modalities of treatment: betamethasone mouthwash, colchicine tablets, and a combination of the two. The trial was conducted in 12 month period and in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013), the principles of International Council for Harmonisation- Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), and all the applicable regulatory requirements. The study was approved by the Guy’s Research Ethics Committee and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. This clinical trial was fully registered with The International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial Number (ISRCTN). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>

                  <p id="Par12">Two hundred and one patients with RAS were screened and 95 were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Screening included haematological investigations for haematinics, renal and liver serology. A number of 106 RAS patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups (see below) and assessed at 3 months intervals for 12 months. A total of 46 males aged 21–63 years (mean 39.2 years) and 60 females aged 22–65 years (mean of 40 years) were included. In 51 subjects, RAS was of the minor type, while 53 had major and only 2 participants had herpetiform RAS.</p>

At each visit, the characteristics of the ulcer attacks in the preceding three months were recorded on a standardised form (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The patients kept a diary of the ulcers; average size, number of ulcers, duration, frequency of ulcer attacks, sites affected, and the intensity of the pain caused by the ulcers. This information was verified clinically whenever possible. An USS form was completed on each study visit, and the ulcers severity was scored independently without referring to the score of previous visits. The USS was expressed as a numerical score, which enabled an objective comparison of the severity of the condition before and after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

Clinicians were not involved in the randomisation or the treatment assignment, and thus were blinded to the treatment taken for the first 3 months of the study. However, due to the different mode of administration of the study medications (as colchicine is a tablet and betamethasone is a mouthwash), neither the participants nor the clinical examiner was blinded further than the first 3 months of the trial. Patients were given a standardized diary and shown how to perform self-examination for the recognition of oral ulcers as previously described.</p>

At each visit, the same examiner evaluated the information recorded in the diary and validated it by history taking before calculating the USS. To minimise bias, the recording and the calculation of the USS was carried out independently of the findings at previous visits, and all participants were assessed twice by the same two clinicians on all visits. The remaining medication tablets were counted at each visit, to assess participants’ compliance with the treatment regime. Those who were deemed non-compliant were excluded from the study. At each visit, blood tests for haematinics, liver and kidney function, blood pressure and weight recordings were all performed to monitor for side effects of the medications.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par42">This clinical trial has provided formal clinical evidence for the efficacy of betamethasone mouthwash in the treatment of minor and major RAS. This trial has demonstrated that colchicine tablets alone or in combination with betamethasone mouthwash was an effective treatment, although not significantly better than a regime with betamethasone mouthwash alone. This study has also shown that optimal improvement is perceived in the first three months of treatment but that for betamethasone mouthwash, at least six months of continuous treatment is required for optimal improvement in ulcer severity.</p>
              <p id="Par43">One novel aspect of this study was to undertake a longer-term trial to address the question of how long a treatment regime was needed to induce a more sustained reduction in ulcer severity. This meant that it was deemed ethically inappropriate to include a non-treatment group, even though there are studies which have shown a significant effect of placebo in the management of RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Further review of patients after the period of active treatment would have allowed assessment of the longer-term treatment effects. This was not part of the protocol in this study but can be recommended for future studies. Furthermore, this trial showed that patients who did not respond to treatment in the first three months (14% irrespective of age or gender), were highly unlikely to do so subsequently. It is therefore recommended that in unresponsive RAS patients, the medication should be changed after three months of treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par44">The effectiveness of colchicine in the management of RAS has been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but there is no comparison of its efficacy with other therapies nor long term sequential assessment to determine the optimum therapy duration or dose. Our findings showed that colchicine at a low dose of 500 mcg a day had a significant effect especially on minor RAS over the first 3 months of therapy only, with little further improvement seen thereafter, except in major RAS in combination with betamethasone mouthwash. This relatively low dose of colchicine was chosen to minimise side effects previously reported with higher doses. In a study by Oh et al. (2022) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], 22.8% of the study group who were taking colchicine 1.2 mg/day experienced side effects within 2 weeks of starting the treatment, which resulted in its discontinuation. Interestingly, a reduction from 1.2 mg/day to 300–600 mcg/day reduced the side effects in more than a third of the patients. Therefore, precautions were taken into consideration when designing the current study, and thus, a dose of 500 mcg/day was deemed to be the optimum therapeutic dose. However, our data also suggest that in cases where colchicine 500 mcg daily is not effective after three months, either the dose can be increased to 1000 mcg or an alternative therapy should be considered.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Regarding adverse effects, Six of the 106 participants reported adverse reactions, and all were on colchicine. Adverse effects of colchicine have been reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The benefits anticipated to be gained from prescribing colchicine (with or without betamethasone) have therefore to be balanced against its potential side effects.</p>
              <p id="Par46">The results of the present study showed that topical betamethasone, systemic colchicine or a combined therapy of colchicine 500 mcg per day plus betamethasone mouthwash all resulted in significant benefits within the first three months of therapy. However, with topical treatment, the maximum reduction in mean ulcer scores was reached by nine months therapy. This suggests that this therapy could be sustained for up to 9 months for maximum effect and without detectable adverse reactions. Further reduction in the USS with dual therapy continued for 6 months in the minor RAS group and at 9 months in the major RAS group, suggesting that more sustained therapy might be needed for effective responses in major RAS. This supports a perception that for the management of the severe and constantly recurring ulcers, topical treatment may not be enough and systemic medications can be added. However, our results suggest that the added benefit of taking colchicine 500 mcg tablet daily was limited and possibly increasing the dose, in line with its use medically, may be more effective.</p>
              <p id="Par47">One of the limitations in the present study is the lack of a placebo controlled group, which was due to the study’s long timespan of 12 months and the fact that patients with severe types of RAS in particular could not be left without treatment for the long period of the clinical trial. Another limitation of this study is the lack of blinding in clinicians and participants, which was due to the.</p>
              <p id="Par48">differences in the mode of the applications since one is a tablet and the other is a mouthwash.</p>
              <p id="Par49">In conclusion, topical betamethasone mouthwash was shown to be an effective treatment for minor and major RAS subtypes and this study provided evidence for its efficacy as a first-line treatment in RAS. The effect of therapy on RAS may be incremental and the optimal duration of treatment was six months.</p>
