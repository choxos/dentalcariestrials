                  <p id="Par2">This cluster, randomized trial, included visually impaired children from preschool to 10th grade (32 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 200), in Tehran, Iran, in 2018–2019. A questionnaire was filled out through face to face interviews at baseline regarding age, gender, status of visual impairment, and place of residence. The Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) and Bleeding on Probing (BOP) were examined afterward. Classes were randomly assigned to three groups through simple randomization: 1. Art group (ATP, game-based, and music-based education (11 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 66); 2. Mothers group (children received ATP and their mothers received education by telephone (10 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 73); and 3. Control group (children received ATP (11 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 61). Children received reinforcement after 1 and 2 weeks. Follow-up oral examinations were performed after 1 and 2 months by a blind calibrated examiner. Descriptive statistics were performed using Chi-Square, and ANOVA tests by SPSS (version 22). In analytic statistics, two-level mixed-effects models for BOP and OHI-S were fitted using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.4. Both models fitted with the grouping variable and time (baseline, 1, and 2 months after interventions) as the fixed effects.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The mean age (SD) of the children was 12.29 (3.45) years (range: 6–17). Male children (67%) more than female children (33%) participated in the study. Also, 35.5% were blind, and 12% resided at the dormitory. The art and mothers groups had no statistically significant difference compared with the control group, in terms of OHI-S (<italic>P</italic> = 0.92, and 0.39, respectively) and BOP (OR = 0.64, and 0.66, respectively).

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">Visual impairment is an important public health problem worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Globally, about 2.2 billion people suffer from a visual impairment or blindness. Among children, congenital cataract and retinopathy of prematurity are the leading causes of vision impairment in low-income and high income countries respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Iran age-standardized prevalence of vision loss was 12.3% in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">Studies show that poor oral hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], various levels of periodontal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], trauma to the anterior teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and hypoplastic teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] are frequent in visually impaired children. Poor oral health in these children may be caused by different factors including lack of knowledge and behavior about oral hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], infrequent dental visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], difficulty to access oral care facilities, and neglection of parents and health providers while the focus is kept predominantly on managing their existing disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Some difficulties such as the lack of hand-eye coordination in visually impaired children can affect the quality of plaque removing. Also, they lack the ability to visually assess whether visible dental caries or gingival bleeding exist during tooth brushing, which consequently affects the oral health status and early dental visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Visually impaired children depend more on sound, smell, touch, taste, and speech to orient themselves to a situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Such children have an equal right to receive the proper oral health education and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated improvement in oral hygiene following oral health education among visually impaired children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Various methods of oral health education were used for visually impaired children to promote their oral health. Most of the studies revealed that multisensory education is more effective than unisensory methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Educating the brushing method through Audio Tactile Performance (ATP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] involves auditory and tactile senses, which are more powerful in visually impaired people. Using educational casts and music-based education were also effective for visually impaired children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Games are desirable learning modes, as they can make oral health education more interesting and effective for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, to our knowledge game-based education, has not been used in the oral health education of visually impaired children.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In addition, mothers of visually impaired children, accompany their children more than mothers with normal children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Also, they face difficult aspects of child care, access to health care, overloading due to the child dependency, and lack of support within their own families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, we lack studies to assess the role of mothers in the oral health of visually impaired children. Consequently, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare different oral health educational methods to find the most effective ones for these group of children. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of oral health educational methods using ATP technique alone, ATP combined with oral health education for mothers, and ATP and art package on the oral hygiene status of children with visual impairment.</p>

                <p id="Par28">The present study was a double-blind, parallel, cluster, randomized trial in 6–17-year-old visually impaired school children in Tehran, Iran. Study procedures consisted of a pilot, baseline study, interventions, two reinforcements for allocated groups, and follow-up examinations after 1 and 2 months.

                <p id="Par29">The design and planning of this study were based on the modified PRECEDE-PROCEED oral health promotion model. PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis) highlights a diagnostic planning process to develop the targeted public health programs. PROCEED (Policy, Regulatory, and Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development) outlines the implementation and evaluation of the intervention designed in the PRECEDE component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The different parts of the model in the present study are following: 1- Fluoride therapy is routinely provided for the 1st to 6th grades by the Iranian Ministry of Health, as a national program, twice a year in all schools (it is considered as an environmental factor); 2- The educational level of mothers is an enabling factor; 3- children’s oral health conceptions are predisposing factor; and 4- Mothers’ oral health knowledge, attitude, and behavior as well as supervision of child’s tooth brushing are considered as reinforcing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study population and randomization (allocation concealment mechanism)</title>
                <p id="Par30">There were three schools - one school for girls (<italic>n</italic> = 97) and two schools for boys (<italic>n</italic> = 150 and 53) - for visually impaired children in Tehran. Total of 300 children were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were being in preschool to 10th grade (aged 6–17 years) and having parents’ consent. Thus 214 children of 300, in 32 classes met the inclusion criteria (only three children did not have parents’ consent). Children were excluded from the study if they were not cooperative, and/or had mental or other physical disabilities or were absent in the baseline study. Consequently, data collection was performed for 200 children at baseline.</p>

Within each layer in each school, simple randomization by Microsoft Excel was done by a colleague who was blind to the study. So, each class was randomly entered into one of the three study groups (control group, mothers group, art group). Consequently, eligible participants were 200 in 32 classes, which were divided into three groups: control (11 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 61), mothers (10 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 73), and art (11 classes, <italic>n</italic> = 66).</p>

                  <p id="Par33">Outcome measures included improvement in oral hygiene status measured through a decrease in the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S) and bleeding on probing (BOP). The OHI-S described by J. Greene and J. R. Vermillion in 1964 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and consisted of debris index (DI) and calculus index (CI). Six tooth surfaces are scored: (3, 8, 14,19, 24, and 30), and in the permanent dentition or (A, E, F, K, O, and P) in the primary dentition on a scale of 0 to 3. The debris scores were added together and divided by the number of examined tooth for each person to calculate DI. The same process was used to obtain CI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The sum of DI and CI were defined as OHI-S. In this study OHI-S was considered as a quantitative outcome variable. The examination for BOP proceeded from the first to the fourth quadrants using the WHO Periodontal Probe. Buccal and mediobuccal were examined for the presence or absence of bleeding. Bleeding on less than 30% of all probed sites for each person, was considered as local and bleeding on 30% of sites or higher was defined as general bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For analysis, local and general bleeding were coded “YES” and absence of bleeding was coded “NO”. Baseline examination was done by the first examiner and post-intervention examinations were performed by a blind calibrated examiner.</p>

First the two examiners reviewed how to examine for BOP and OHI-S. They examined one volunteer teacher to observe the performance of each another and discuss agreement on coding.</p>
                  <p id="Par35">For intra-examiner calibration, each examiner examined 10 children for BOP assessment in separate classes. The second assessment was done after half an hour to resolve previous bleeding (Kappa for BOP = 1). They also assessed DI and CI for OHI-S. As due to removing the debris by explorer during the first examination, it was not possible to assess DI again, only for CI, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated (ICC = 1).</p>
                  <p id="Par36">For inter-examiner calibration, 20 children were examined by both examiners. The first examiner assessed BOP, half an hour later the second examiner assessed BOP again (Kappa for BOP = 1). For DI index, in each child, one of the examiners collected debris by explorer, then according to the amount of debris on explorer, both recorded the score in separate assessment forms (ICC for DI = 0.88). For CI they examined children separately (ICC for CI = 0.95). In total, ICC for OHI-S was calculated 0.89.</p>

An oral health education, using ATP technique and art package was performed subsequently. The results of the pilot study were discussed among the research team members and minor revisions were performed to the study protocol where needed. The main revision was for brushing technique. At first, scrub for 6–9 and modified bass for 10–17- year-old children had been considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

              <p id="Par53">To the best of our knowledge, no available published data has investigated the role of mothers and game in improving oral hygiene in visually impaired children. Since, there was oral health improvement in all the three groups with no statistical significant difference among them, ATP technique, which was served in all groups, is an effective oral health education method to improve the oral health status of visually impaired school children in the short term. It was in line with Hebbal’s study that showed pre- and post-education through ATP decreased mean plaque scores significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A verbal explanation with friendly communication encouraged the students to cooperate. Hand over hand guidance to teach brushing provided a proper tactile sense and positive emotional feeling. Their perfect consequent performance of tooth brushing made them confident to do it at home.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Our findings did not reveal any differences among the groups that are in line with some other studies. Gautam and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] showed that in 6–16-year-old visually impaired children, there was a decrease in the mean plaque scores at all-time intervals after a different combination of audio, Braille, and tactile education methods in individual groups compared with the baseline but there was no difference among the groups (group A: audio aids + Braille, group B: audio aids + tactile models, and group C: audio aids + Braille + tactile models) after one month. Mahantesha and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] confirmed that even though both oral hygiene instructions by audio recordings and written instructions in Braille showed a decrease in the plaque score, inter-group comparison of Patient Hygiene Performance (PHP) index score was not statistically significant after three months among 6–20-year-old visually impaired children. The findings of the study done by Shetty and others showed improvement in gingival health status and oral hygiene status after using a specially designed educational model with music and the cooperation of caretakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par55">Although the children have enjoyed game and music-based education at class time, most of them gave negative feedback in the reinforcing sessions that brushing without music was easier to do at home. It indicates that ATP method is more feasible and effective for visually impaired children.</p>
              <p id="Par56">To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to evaluate mothers’ role in oral health promotion of visually impaired children. Although in the present study, educating mothers made no statistically significant difference in terms of mean OHI-S and odds of BOP, it is recommended to design similar studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-ups for further evaluation of the mothers’ role.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Tehran is the multicultural capital of Iran due to large immigration from different areas of the country. Thus, our study findings can be generalized to all schools for visually impaired children in Iran. However further studies at international level should examine whether these findings have wider generalizability. Having considered the explanation of the methods in details, a suitable applicability is expected for the present study.</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p id="Par58">One of the strengths of the present study was the high response rate of the participants (95–99%). In addition, all three schools for visually impaired children in Tehran were included. Moreover, Stratification by grade before cluster randomization is another strength, which helped to have more homogeneity in the groups regarding the grade. Blinding in this trial, regarding the outcome measure assessment and data analysis, could reduce the risk of biases. Consequently, we believe that the findings of this study have an acceptable internal validity.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par59">In terms of limitations of the present study, the research team have recognized the potential bias that might have been caused by the presence of unequal number of children in classes. Randomization among classes instead of individuals, helped to control the interventions’ contamination. However, unequal number of children in classes, might cause non-homogeneity (random bias) according to gender among the groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Furthermore, School time schedule limited us to have longer follow-ups. This might be considered as another limitation of our work. In addition, in the mothers group, 14 children of 73, resided at the dormitory. Despite, we asked their mothers to call every day and encourage them to use oral health instructions, these children lost the opportunity to have the face to face daily advice of their mothers.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par60">In the present study, no statistical difference was observed regarding the effect of oral health education methods on the oral health of school children with visual impairment. It seems that the ATP technique alone can be an effective method to provide oral health education and improve the oral health status of visually impaired children. The results of this study can guide policymakers to design suitable school-based programs to improve the oral health of visually impaired children.</p>
