              <abstract>
                <p>It was the aim of this 24-mo randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate
whether the survival of a single median implant placed in the edentulous
mandible to retain a complete denture is not compromised by immediate loading.
Secondary outcomes were differences in prosthetic complications between the
loading principles. Each of the 158 patients who received an implant was
randomly assigned to the immediate loading group (<italic>n</italic> = 81) or the delayed loading group (<italic>n</italic> = 77). Recall visits were performed 1 mo after implant placement
(for only the delayed loading group) and 1, 4, 12, and 24 mo after implant
loading. Nine implants failed in the immediate loading group, all within the
first 3 mo of implant loading, and 1 implant failed in the delayed loading group
prior to loading. Noninferiority of implant survival of the immediate loading
group, as compared with the delayed loading group, could not be shown (<italic>P</italic> = 0.81). Consistent with this result, a secondary
analysis with Fisher exact test revealed that the observed difference in implant
survival between the treatment groups was indeed statistically significant
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.019). The most frequent prosthetic
complications and maintenance interventions in the mandible were retention
adjustments, denture fractures, pressure sores, and matrix exchanges. There was
only 1 statistically significant difference between the groups regarding the
parameter “fracture of the denture base in the ball attachment area” (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). The results indicate that immediate
loading of a single implant in the edentulous mandible reveals inferior survival
than that of delayed loading and therefore should be considered only in
exceptional cases (German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00003730).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>A single implant to retain a complete denture in the mandible was firstly introduced
by Cordioli et al. in the 1990s (<xref rid="bibr8-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Cordioli 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Cordioli et al. 1997</xref>). In this first clinical trial, 21 patients
received 1 mandibular midline implant that was used to retain an existing mandibular
denture with an O-ring attachment. A submerged healing protocol was chosen, and
implants were loaded 4 mo after implant placement. After 5 y of observation, all
implants survived, and remarkable improvements of all parameters of oral comfort and
prostheses function were observed. Since then, different clinical investigations
with varying study designs have been conducted, mostly with a small number of
participants over a short- to midterm observation period (<xref rid="bibr14-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Kern 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Passia and Kern 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>While 1 investigation followed a submerged healing protocol with late loading after 3
mo of healing (<xref rid="bibr15-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Krennmair and Ulm
2001</xref>), others chose a nonsubmerged healing protocol and loaded the
implants from 7 d to 3 mo after implant placement (<xref rid="bibr12-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Gonda et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr2-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Alsabeeha et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Grover et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr4-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Bryant et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Passia et al. 2015</xref>). The implant survival
rates were overall high between 91.7% and 100%. <xref rid="bibr17-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Kronström et al. (2014)</xref> loaded the implants
immediately at the day of implant placement. In this investigation, an implant
survival rate of only 82% was obtained, with all implant failures occurring within
the first 12 mo of observation (<xref rid="bibr16-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Kronström et al. 2010</xref>). <xref rid="bibr19-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Liddelow and Henry (2010)</xref> placed 7 implants
with machined surfaces and 25 implants with oxidized surfaces and loaded them
immediately at the day of implant placement. In the machined surface group, the
failure rate was 37.5%, but all implants with oxidized surfaces survived during an
observation period of 36 mo.</p>
              <p>According to a consensus statement from 2009, the literature supports immediate
loading of microroughened implants with fixed prostheses and overdentures in the
edentulous mandible, with the understanding that this treatment is complex and can
be considered for clinicians with the appropriated education, experience, and skill
(<xref rid="bibr35-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al. 2009</xref>).
Edentulous patients, who are often dissatisfied with their complete mandibular
dentures (<xref rid="bibr10-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Fiske et al.
1998</xref>), might especially benefit from a direct loading protocol, which
would finally lead to a shorter overall treatment time. They could benefit earlier
from the advantages provided by the implant treatment (<xref rid="bibr9-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Cune et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>In 2014, a consensus statement on loading protocols concluded that, due to a lack of
research, immediate loading of a single implant in the edentulous mandible may not

loading protocol on the survival rate of a single mandibular implant in the
edentulous mandible has never been investigated in a randomized clinical trial.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the present multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to test
the hypothesis that the prosthetic rehabilitation of the edentulous mandible with a
single median implant and immediate loading will offer a noninferior implant
survival rate as the rehabilitation with 1 implant and a second-stage surgery. The
secondary aims were to assess differences in prosthetic complications and
maintenance interventions between the study groups. Further secondary outcomes, not
addressed in the article, were patients’ denture satisfaction, chewing efficacy,
oral health–related quality of life, and bone loss around the implant as well as in
the posterior region of the mandible.</p>

              <p>The Institutional Review Boards of all participating centers approved the study
protocol of the present clinical trial. The study was registered at the German
Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, DRKS00003730). The
clinical trial followed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)
statement guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
prior to screening for possible inclusion. Experienced clinicians from 9 German
university hospitals following previously defined standard operating procedures
performed patients’ treatments as well as all follow-up investigations. To avoid
bias, each study center assigned 1 or 2 surgeons to carry out the treatment
procedures and 1 or 2 investigators to perform the follow-up investigations.</p>

              <p>Implant placement was performed with local anesthesia. A crestal incision of 15 to 20
mm was chosen to elevate a full-thickness flap. If necessary, bone reduction was
performed to allow placement of an implant with a diameter of 3.8 mm without bone
augmentation. Finally, 163 patients received an implant with an air-abraded and
acid-etched surface (3.8 × 11 mm, Promote Plus; Camlog Biotechnologies) in the
midline of the edentulous mandible. A final insertion torque of at least 30 N cm and
an implant stability quotient ≥60 were necessary before randomization. Patients
whose implants did not fulfill these conditions were excluded from the study and
treated according to a conventional delayed loading protocol. Finally, 158 patients
were randomly assigned to the immediate loading group (<italic>n</italic> = 81) or the delayed loading group (<italic>n</italic>
= 77) by opening a sealed envelope with the allocation. The trial statistician,
using block randomization with a variable block size and an allocation ratio of 1:1,
performed randomization centrally, which was stratified according to the patient’s
residual bone height (class II or III according to <xref rid="bibr22-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">McGarry et al. 1999</xref>) as well as the study
center. Due to the obvious differences between the treatment groups, neither the
patient nor the surgeon could be blinded.</p>
              <p>The existing mandibular dentures were connected to the implant with a ball attachment
(Dalbo-Plus Elliptic; Cendres Métaux) at the day of implant surgery (immediate
loading group) or 3 mo later at the day of second-stage surgery (delayed loading
group). The matrices were integrated into the existing denture base intraorally with
a self-curing bis-acrylate resin (LuxaPick-up; DMG). The multistage screening
process with a detailed sample size calculation, the surgical approach, the
randomization, and the prosthodontic procedure have been described in detail
elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr28-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Passia et al.

Abou-Ayash, et al. 2017</xref>). Follow-up investigations were performed 1 mo
after implant placement (for only the delayed loading group) and 1, 4, 12, and 24 mo
after implant loading.</p>
              <p>Peri-implant conditions (i.e., peri-implant probing depths and bleeding on probing;
<xref rid="bibr6-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Cordaro et al. 2013</xref>)
were recorded at 4 sides for each implant. The following parameters regarding
prosthetic complications and maintenance interventions were recorded for the
maxillary and mandible dentures: fracture of the denture base; in the mandible, the
area of the fracture was recorded additionally (area of the ball attachment,
fracture between the canines, or fracture between the canine and the distal margin
of the denture base), number of relinings, pressure-sore at the denture base or the
margin. For the mandible, the following parameters were additionally recorded:
exchange of the ball attachment, exchange of the matrix, activation/adjustment of
the matrix, and other complications.</p>

                <title>Sample Size and Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The primary endpoint of the study was the survival rate of the single median
implant after 2 y. This is a binomial random variable, and the survival
probability was assumed to be 97% in both treatment groups. An inferiority of 7%
of the survival rate in the direct loading group versus the conventional loading
group was considered clinically tolerable due to the supposed advantages of an
immediate loading, such as avoiding a second-stage surgery. Under these
assumptions, a 1-sided test of binomial parameters at a 2.5% significance level
has a power of 80% to reveal the noninferiority of the immediately loaded
implant if the sample size is 148 (74 per group). Based on a loss-to-follow-up
rate of approximately 20%, a total of 180 patients (90 per group) was considered
necessary.</p>
                <p>The statistical analysis was performed with the per-protocol set for the implant
survival rates and the safety analysis set for prosthetic complications. Implant
survival rates were estimated and provided with exact 1-sided 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs). In addition to the noninferiority analysis, a comparison of
the 2 treatment groups with regard to implant survival was carried out with
Fisher exact test. For the analysis of the prosthetic complications, Fisher
exact test was used as well. SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM) and R 3.2.3 (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing) was used for analysis.</p>

              <p>Nine implants (12.2%, 1-sided 95% CI: 0.0% to 20.2%) failed in the immediate loading
group and were removed. Of these, 5 implants failed during the first month of
loading, while the other 4 failed within the next 2 mo. In the delayed loading
group, 1 implant (1.5%, 1-sided 95% CI: 0.0% to 5.4%) had to be removed during
second-stage surgery due to a lack of osseointegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034517736063">Fig. 2</xref>). No further implants failed within
the 24-mo observation period with loading. Noninferiority of implant survival of the
immediate loading group, as compared with the delayed loading group, could not be
shown (<italic>P</italic> = 0.81). Consistent with this result, a
secondary analysis with Fisher exact test revealed that the observed difference in
implant survival between the treatment groups was indeed statistically significant
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.019). Among the participants with implant
loss in the immediate loading group, 2 were smokers (as were 14 others with no
failure). Five patients with implant loss were assigned to McGarry type 2 and 4
patients to McGarry type 3. The patient from the delayed loading group whose implant
failed was a smoker (as were 14 others with no failure) with diagnosed diabetes (as
were 15 others with no failure); this patient was assigned to McGarry type 3.</p>

              <p>Mean probing depths after 24 mo ranged from 2.37 mm to 2.74 mm for the immediate
loading group and from 2.20 mm to 2.47 mm for the delayed loading group, with no
statistically significant difference between them (<italic>P</italic>
&gt; 0.09). Bleeding on probing occurred at 11 (16.9%, 95% CI: 8.8% to 28.3%) of the
implants of the immediate loading group and 14 (21.1%, 95% CI: 12.1% to 33.0%) of
the delayed loading group also, with no statistical significant differences between
groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.657). Regarding prosthetic complications
and maintenance interventions, only the parameter “fracture of the denture base in
the area of the ball attachment” revealed a statistical significant difference
between the treatment groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007; <xref rid="table3-0022034517736063" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most common
complications and maintenance interventions in both groups were “adjustment of the
retention,” “relining of the mandibular denture,” and “pressure sore” in the
mandible. The most reported “other complication” was a reintegration of a detached
matrix, either due to a former malpositioning or an accidental detachment during
function. This complication occurred 10 times within the immediate loading group and
8 times within the delayed loading group. A hyperplastic gingiva in the area of the
ball attachment was reported for 5 patients of the immediate loading group. This
complication did not occur in the delayed loading group.</p>

              <p>The initially estimated number of participants of 180 (90 per group) was not achieved

              <p>The hypothesis has to be rejected—that the prosthetic rehabilitation of the
edentulous mandible with a single median implant and immediate loading will offer a
comparable survival rate as the rehabilitation with 1 implant and second-stage
surgery. There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment
groups regarding implant survival.</p>
              <p>In general, the immediate loading of implants supporting overdentures is challenging
and considered a valid treatment option for clinicians with the appropriate skills
(<xref rid="bibr35-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al. 2009</xref>).
According to several systematic literature reviews, the immediate loading of 2 or 4
implants in the edentulous mandible with overdentures is well documented and reveals
high implant survival rates of between 94% and 100% (<xref rid="bibr1-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Alsabeeha et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Schimmel et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Zygogiannis et al. 2016</xref>). In a pilot study
on 3 immediately loaded implants to retain a complete mandibular overdenture, the
implant survival rate was 100% after an observation period of 2 y (<xref rid="bibr34-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Stephan et al. 2007</xref>). An
investigation by <xref rid="bibr16-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Kronström et
al. (2010)</xref> on the immediate loading of mandibular overdentures supported
by 1 or 2 implants revealed implant survival rates between 81.6% and 82.4%. The
survival rates of both groups were not statistically significant. In a clinical
trial by <xref rid="bibr19-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Liddelow and Henry
(2010)</xref>, the survival rate of immediately loaded implants with air-abraded
and acid-etched surfaces supporting a mandibular overdenture was 100% after 36 mo of
observation. In the present study, the implant survival rate after 2 y was 87.8% for
the immediate loading group. This is slightly higher than the implant survival rate
reported by Kronström et al. but considerably lower than the survival rate reported
by Liddelow and Henry for 1 implant and the reported average implant survival rate
for 2 or 4 implants supporting a mandibular overdenture. In the present study, the
retention elements were connected to the denture base intraorally. Kronström et al.
took an impression and sent the denture to the laboratory. That might have led to
inaccuracies, resulting in increased implant loading and a slightly higher implant
failure rate.</p>
              <p>In the present study, surgical and prosthetic procedures were carried out at 9
different university hospitals. Although all participating dentists were experienced
clinicians following previously defined standard operation procedures, one might be
less experienced with the implant or the attachment system, as well as the concept
of a single implant in the edentulous mandible in general. It is known from the
literature that learning curves have to be expected (<xref rid="bibr32-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Preiskel and Tsolka 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et al. 1997</xref>). This
fact might have led to higher failure rates in the present study when compared with
the results obtained by <xref rid="bibr19-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Liddelow
and Henry (2010)</xref>. Additionally, the intraoral integration of the
attachment system into the denture base is a technique sensitive procedure. This is
supported by the fact that detached matrices had to be reintegrated into the denture
bases 18 times in total. Even minimal malpositioning of the matrix on top of the
ball attachment may result in an implant overload and increase the risk of
failure.</p>
              <p>Another aspect that should be considered is the influence of the overdenture’s
movement and its biomechanical behavior. <xref rid="bibr21-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2013)</xref> investigated the
influence of the implant number on the biomechanical behavior of mandibular
overdentures using a 3-dimensional finite element analysis. They found that the
single-implant overdenture rotated over the implant from side to side under vertical
load on the lower incisors, but they found no obvious increase of strain in
peri-implant bone. In another laboratory investigation, <xref rid="bibr24-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Oda et al. (2017)</xref> revealed significantly
smaller vertical displacement of a single implant–retained overdenture versus a
2-implant overdenture upon anterior loading. However, the authors also mention that,
under clinical conditions, the single implant–retained overdenture may allow complex
denture movements, as a single implant cannot limit the direction of movement.
Although patients with severely resorbed mandibles were excluded in the present
study, complex denture movements were still possible, as a single implant can act as
a rotational axis. This might result in strong extra-axial implant loading during
function, which might negatively influence the implant stability of the immediately
loaded implants, resulting in more implant failures.</p>
              <p>In the conventional loading group, 1 implant failed, resulting in a survival rate of
98.5%. This result falls well within published results on implant survival from
other investigations on the single mandibular implant in the edentulous mandible
(<xref rid="bibr29-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Passia and Kern
2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Regarding prosthetic complications, the most common maintenance intervention was an
adjustment of the retention element in both treatment groups. This is in line with
other investigations on the single midline implant in the edentulous mandible (<xref rid="bibr7-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Cordioli et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr2-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Alsabeeha et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Passia et al. 2015</xref>) and
seems to be the most common maintenance intervention for implant-retained
overdentures (<xref rid="bibr3-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Andreiotelli et al.
2010</xref>). A fracture of the denture base in the area of the ball attachment
occurred significantly more often in the immediate loading group than in the delayed
loading group. A fracture of the denture base in the area of the attachment was the
most frequent complication in the investigation by <xref rid="bibr19-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Liddelow and Henry (2010)</xref> with a direct
implant loading protocol. When implants are directly loaded at the day of implant
placement, the soft tissue in the implant area might be slightly swollen. Also, due
to necessary bone reduction in the anterior region, a surplus of soft tissue in the
implant area might occur and has to be well adapted during suturing. After
second-stage surgery, the surgical area is smaller than after an implant placement,
and the soft tissue adaptation is easier. In the present investigation, the ball
attachments were integrated into the already-existing denture bases. The recesses,
which have to be prepared to pick up the matrix, will therefore be slightly bigger
in the immediate loading group than the delayed loading group. In most cases, a
metal framework did not support the denture bases. After the matrix was integrated
into previously prepared recesses, the acrylic resin in the area of the ball
attachment was rather thin, especially in the labiolingual dimension, and thus prone
to fracture. All patients who experienced a second fracture of the denture base were
offered a metal framework to support the implant area.</p>
              <p>The revision of the dentures in both groups at the day of implant loading also
explains the relining in approximately 10% of the dentures in both groups during the
follow-up period. The tissues adapt to the new situation after bone reduction and
implant placement, resulting in a slight misfit and need for relining.</p>
              <p>The surplus of soft tissue in the implant area after bone reduction might also lead
to a hyperplastic gingiva in the area of the ball attachment, which was observed in
5 cases of the immediately loaded group. <xref rid="bibr20-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Liddelow and Henry (2007)</xref> also reported a
gingiva hypertrophy in some cases after immediate loading. They eliminated the
problem by using a viscoelastic relining material in the implant area during the
first weeks of implant loading. <xref rid="bibr31-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al. (2001)</xref> reported similar problems in a 2-implant overdenture
study. They definitely relined all denture bases 2 wk after implant placement
according to their study protocol. In the present study, all patients achieved
healthy soft tissue conditions after a soft tissue conditioning of the hypertrophic
gingiva in the implant area.</p>
              <p>An interim analysis was performed after all patients had completed the 4-mo follow-up
examination (after loading). This analysis considered only the secondary outcomes of
this clinical trial (<xref rid="bibr23-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Mundt et
al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-0022034517736063" ref-type="bibr">Passia,
Att, et al. 2017</xref>). This analysis had no influence on the primary
endpoints for this study or the further conduct of the study, since all implants had
been placed at this point and no further interventions were performed.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Over an observation period of 2 y, single midline implants in the edentulous mandible
that were immediately loaded revealed a statistically significant lower survival
rate than those loaded 3 mo after implant placement and second-stage surgery. The
results of the present study indicate that immediate loading of a single implant in
the edentulous mandible should be considered only in exceptional cases.</p>
