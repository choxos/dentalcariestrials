                  <p>Bonded retainers are widely used to maintain the positions of anterior teeth
after orthodontic treatment. Various types of bonded retainer exist however,
there is a lack of evidence to indicate which type is superior.</p>

                  <p>A total of 68 patients were randomly allocated to receive either upper and
lower Memotain<sup>®</sup> bonded retainers or upper and lower
Ortho-FlexTech™ bonded retainers. Ten trained operators placed and reviewed
the bonded retainers. Measurements were carried out on study models taken at
debond and after six months. Patient satisfaction questionnaires were
completed at six months following debond.</p>

upper Memotain® retainers within six months. Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers
were three times more likely to fail (unadjusted hazard ratio = 2.82, 95%

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Maintaining a stable result after orthodontic treatment remains one of the great
challenges in orthodontics. Changes in tooth position after orthodontic treatment
can arise as a result of relapse, defined as a return of teeth towards their
original position. Unwanted post-treatment changes could also be a consequence of
normal age changes (<xref rid="bibr1-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Abdulraheem
et al., 2020</xref>), which can lead to a reduction in arch length and
perimeter, and a decrease in intercanine width, resulting in crowding and
irregularity, particularly in the lower labial segment. Long-term studies of
patients who stopped wearing their retainers after 1–2 years seem to show an
inevitable and unpredictable level of unwanted post-treatment changes. In some
cases, these changes were so severe that another course of orthodontic treatment was
indicated (<xref rid="bibr17-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Little et al.,
1981</xref>, <xref rid="bibr18-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>).
This has resulted in an increasing number of clinicians recommending long-term
retention to resist relapse (<xref rid="bibr19-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Littlewood et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is a shortage of high-quality evidence to clearly indicate which is the best
type of retention regimen to use for long-term retention (<xref rid="bibr4-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Al-Moghrabi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Littlewood et al., 2016</xref>).
Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed retainers and removable retainers have
not conclusively shown one type of retainer to be better than the other (<xref rid="bibr3-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Al-Moghrabi et al., 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr8-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Forde et al., 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr11-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Krämer et al., 2020</xref>,
<xref rid="bibr12-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Storey et al., 2018</xref>). In
one randomised trial it was shown that after four years, adherence with a removable
retainer had significantly dropped, resulting in better retention with fixed
retainers in the lower arch (<xref rid="bibr3-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Al-Moghrabi et al., 2018</xref>). Patients have expressed a preference for
bonded retainers due to the fact that they do not need to remember to wear them

              <p>As the long-term benefits of long-term retention have been recognised, there has been
an increased use of bonded retainers. However, it is important to recognise that
they do have potential complications (<xref rid="bibr14-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kučera et al., 2021</xref>). These include:
failure (<xref rid="bibr10-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kocher et al.,
2019</xref>); potential for adverse effect on periodontal health (<xref rid="bibr26-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Storey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Tacken et al., 2010</xref>);
unwanted tooth movement with the retainer in situ (<xref rid="bibr15-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kučera and Marek, 2016</xref>); and adverse
effects on general health (<xref rid="bibr7-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Eliades et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Failures of bonded retainers can occur as a result of debonding of the composite from
the enamel, failure between the wire and the composite or fracture of the retainer
(<xref rid="bibr14-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kučera et al.,
2021</xref>). The most common failure occurs between the adhesive and the enamel
(<xref rid="bibr6-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Dahl and Zachrisson,
1991</xref>; <xref rid="bibr8-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Forde et al.,
2018</xref>), which may be the result of poor clinical technique (in particular,
lack of moisture control during bonding). Composite does not bond chemically to wire
retainers, so this bond relies on mechanical retention between the composite and the
surface of the wire. The likelihood of wire fracture depends on the type and
diameter of wire used, and whether there is repeated stress on the wire, as a result
of direct occlusal trauma from the opposing arch or repeated flexing of the wire
(<xref rid="bibr14-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kučera et al.,
2021</xref>).</p>
              <p>The aetiology of unwanted tooth movement with a bonded retainer still in situ is
poorly understood but could be due to a tooth-moving force from within the wire, or
a force inadvertently applied by the clinician or the patient. It has been suggested
that there may be inherent activity in the archwire, which may be placed in an
active position during bonding, or distorted due to occlusal contacts or patient
habits (<xref rid="bibr14-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kučera et al.,
2021</xref>). It is unclear which is the best type of bonded retainer to
minimise these various complications, while also offering reliable retention and
being both comfortable and acceptable to patients.</p>
              <p>In recent years, two new fixed retainers have entered the market,
Memotain<sup>®</sup>, a CAD/CAM nitinol retainer, and Ortho-FlexTech™, a
rectangular-chain retainer that can be directly bonded at the chairside.</p>
              <p>Memotain<sup>®</sup> is laser-cut from a nitinol sheet or blank, so no bending of the
wire is required. The bending sites are thought to be sites of increased risk of
wire fracture, so the Memotain<sup>®</sup> method of manufacture aims to eliminate
this (<xref rid="bibr13-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kravitz et al.,
2017</xref>). Once cut, the wire is electropolished in an ion-charged bath that
smooths, cleans and polishes the wire, increasing corrosion resistance and
reportedly making the wire less susceptible to microbial colonisation. This process
also aims to round off the corners of the square wire potentially increasing patient
comfort. To manufacture the Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainer, a detailed record of the
lingual/palatal surfaces of the teeth in the form of a study model or 3D scan is
required. An opposing model and a record of the occlusion is required to allow the
digital positioning of upper retainers away from any occlusal interferences. The
effectiveness of Memotain<sup>®</sup> was recently assessed in a randomised
controlled clinical trial, undertaken in a university clinic, comparing it with
five-strand co-axial stainless-steel wires in the lower arch. This study showed no
difference in periodontal outcome or survival rates over six months (<xref rid="bibr9-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kartal et al., 2021</xref>). In
another university-based randomised controlled clinical trial investigating
retention of the lower labial segment, Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers were compared
with multi-stranded stainless-steel twistflex wire, a single-stranded nickel-free
titanium bonded wire and vacuum-formed removable retainers (<xref rid="bibr5-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Alrawas et al., 2021</xref>). The team could find
no significant difference in clinical failure rate between any of the retainers. A
third university-based randomised controlled trial also investigated the performance
of the Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainer in the lower arch. They found there was no
difference in periodontal or relapse outcomes compared with other bonded retainers
(<xref rid="bibr2-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Adanur-Atmaca et al.,
2021</xref>). None of these randomised controlled trials investigated
Memotain<sup>®</sup> in the upper arch.</p>
              <p>Ortho-FlexTech™ (Reliance Orthodontic Products, Itasca, IL, USA) is a 0.039 ×
0.014-inch chairside rectangular-chain bonded retainer available in stainless steel
or 14-carat white gold (etched and non-etched versions). The retainer is measured
and fitted chairside, requires no laboratory input and offers the potential for
quick easy and economical placement. Ortho-FlexTech™ has gained in popularity over
recent years partly due to its ease of adaptability and direct placement properties
(<xref rid="bibr23-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Padmos et al.,

              <p>This study is designed to compare upper and lower Memotain<sup>®</sup> bonded
retainers with Ortho-FlexTech™ bonded retainers.</p>
              <p>The primary aim of the present study was to compare stability, measured in terms of
alignment of the upper and lower labial segments and maintenance of intercanine
widths. The secondary aims were to compare the following: failure rates for each
retainer; patient satisfaction; and performance of each retainer in different
settings (University Teaching Hospital, District General Hospital, and Specialist
Orthodontic Practice) and with different grade operators (Consultant Orthodontist,
Orthodontic Registrar and Orthodontic Therapist).</p>
              <p>The null hypotheses were as follows: there is no difference in the maintenance of the
intercanine width or the alignment of teeth bonded with Memotain<sup>®</sup> and
Ortho-FlexTech™ retainers in both the upper and lower arches; there is no difference
in failure rates of Memotain<sup>®</sup> and Ortho-FlexTech™ retainers in both the
upper and lower arches; there is no difference in patient satisfaction with both
Memotain<sup>®</sup> and Ortho-FlexTech™ retainers in both the upper and lower
arches; and the performance of the retainer is not affected by the setting or the
grade of clinician placing the retainer.</p>

list. Randomisation is carried out on the sealed envelope website using a trial
specific password. As soon as anonymised participant details are entered, details of
the group allocation is given and the primary researcher notified by email. This
method aimed to streamline the randomisation process across multiple sites whilst
making trial recruitment as simple as possible. The system was set up prior to trial
commencement and any details of the randomisation list permanently deleted following
set up.</p>

              <title>Blinding</title>
              <p>It was not possible to blind the operator or patient to the type of retainer used,
but to blind the assessor, a novel technique was used to mask the retainer type
using Blu-Mousse impression paste (Parkell, Edgewood, NY, USA) (<xref rid="fig4-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Once applied, the impression
paste was carefully trimmed with a scalpel blade to allow visualisation of the
landmarks required for stability measurements. Placement of the impression paste was
carried out before any model assessment by someone not involved in the trial.</p>

              <p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants’ baseline
characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes by randomisation group. The data
were tested for normality. Mean (standard deviation) was reported if normally
distributed, and median (interquartile range) was reported if not normally
distributed.</p>
              <p>The primary outcome was stability, measured by the change in Little’s Irregularity
Index and intercanine width. This was compared using the Mann–Whitney
<italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test.</p>
              <p>Failure rates were analysed through survival analysis. Time to first failure of the
retainer was compared between the groups using Kaplan–Meier plots and log-rank test.
Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for treatment
groups using proportional hazard Cox regression. To assess the impact of risk
factors on failure rate, the Cox model would have been further adjusted for
recruiting site and clinical grade.</p>
              <p>Patient satisfaction was reported using descriptive statistics.</p>
              <p>All analyses were performed using R (version 3.4.0). The level of statistical
significance was set as <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

                <title>Trial termination</title>
                <p>The trial was terminated before reaching the full sample size due to the high
number of failures in the upper Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainer group (50% had
some problem). As a result, the research team felt that they could not ethically
continue the trial. From this point, no further patients were recruited to the
trial. Patients who had been recruited to the trial but not yet had their
six-month review were reviewed as normal. For patients already involved in the
trial, at scheduled review appointments, vacuum-formed retainers were offered in
addition to their bonded retainers.</p>
                <p>The results of this study are therefore based on the findings from 62 patients.
When considering the findings of this study, it is therefore important to
consider that it is now underpowered and there is a risk of Type II error,
meaning that the study fails to find a difference when one exists.</p>
                <p>Consideration was given to continuing the trial and assessing only the lower
bonded retainer. At the final research meeting it was clear, however, that both
operators and participants had lost confidence in the Memotain<sup>®</sup>
retainer. Multiple operators commented on no longer feeling comfortable using
Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers on their patients. Given the significant
operator bias this would have introduced, the decision therefore was to stop the
trial.</p>

                <title>Termination of the study due to high failure rate of one retainer</title>
                <p>The trial was terminated early due to the high number of failures noted with the
Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers in the upper arch. The research team noticed
early on that there appeared to be more failures in the upper arch. Concerns
were raised by clinicians that they had seen relapse in some cases that would
require retreatment. After discussion, it was decided that the failure rate
would be reviewed when the first 50 patients recruited to the trial had been
reviewed at six months. It was agreed that if a failure rate of 50% or more was
noted, the trial would be halted. Although the protocol stated reasons for
stopping the trial included harm to patients, this had not been defined with
specific details. In future bonded retainer studies, it may be helpful to make a
clear statement of stopping rules. A failure rate of 50% was noted with
Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers in the upper arch; therefore, a decision was
made by the team to stop further recruitment to the trial. In the protocol, no
removable retainers were provided in addition to the bonded retainers, and there
were concerns that this high level of retainer failure rate may result in high
levels of relapse and the possible need for re-treatment in some patients. The
failure rate for the Ortho-Flextech™ in the upper arch was 17%. It was noted
that the risk of failure was about three times higher in the upper
Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers than the Ortho-Flextech™ retainers. It is
interesting to note that in both groups, approximately one-third of patients had
failures in both arches, and two-thirds had failure only in one arch.</p>
                <p>The most common site of failure with upper Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers was at
the composite/enamel interface. It is not clear why this was the case. It is
often presumed that failure at this interface could be related to poor clinical
technique and moisture control; however, this is less of a problem in the upper
arch. A standardised operating procedure, based on the manufacturer’s
instructions, was used, and this was shared in training videos with the
clinicians; however, it would appear that this was not sufficient to overcome a
difference in clinical skills between operators. It is interesting that the use
of precision-made CAD/CAM bonded retainer with a jig to help positioning of the
wire and fitting of the wire did not seem to help. As noted in the methodology,
there was a 10-day delay in the manufacturing and shipping of the retainer, so
there is a theoretical risk of minor tooth movement with the fixed appliance in
situ during this manufacturing period, which may have compromised the bond.</p>
                <p>Upper bonded retainers are more likely to fail due to the effect of the
occlusion. Despite the retainers being designed virtually with an occlusal
registration, it is possible that some occlusal trauma increased the failure
rate. Another possibility is that there is something inherent in the properties
of the nitinol wire that makes it more likely to cause movement that compromises
this bond.</p>
                <p>Wire fractures were far less common in both groups for retainer failure, but it
was more likely to occur in the Memotain<sup>®</sup> group. This may be related
to the more brittle nature of nitinol. The typical site of failure was between
the upper canines and upper lateral incisors (<xref rid="fig7-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>).</p>
                <p>There was no significant difference in the risk of failure in the lower
retainers; however, the levels of failure were still relatively high at 35%
(Memotain<sup>®</sup>) and 28% (Ortho-Flextech™) after six months. Failure
at the composite/enamel interface was once again the most common site for
retainer failure. These failure rates, although lower than the upper arch, are
still disappointingly high. It is interesting that these higher failure rates
are consistent with some other recent prospective controlled research (<xref rid="bibr21-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Naraghi et al, 2021</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr28-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Wegrodzka et al,
2021</xref>), which tend to show higher failure rates than those measured in
retrospective trials.</p>
                <p>One interesting example of failure in the lower Memotain<sup>®</sup> group was
between the wire and the composite interface (<xref rid="fig7-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref> and <xref rid="fig7-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). This is a much less common site of
failure of a bonded retainer. The consequence of failure at this interface
resulted in space opening up. Composite does not chemically bond to metal, so
this is usually a mechanical-type bond. As discussed earlier, the
Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers are finished with an electropolishing process
to produce a smooth finish to try and improve patient comfort. This smooth
finish may be a disadvantage in the areas where the composite bonds with the
metal. The manufacturers may have recognised this, and a newer version of the
Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainer (not used in this trial) has finger-like
projections added in the areas where the composite will bond, which aims to
improve the mechanical bond between the wire and the composite (<xref rid="fig10-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

                <p>There was no statistically significant difference noted between the different

not being reached. Further research, with an appropriate sample size would be
required to determine whether the different setting or grade of operator would
affect the performance of bonded retainers.</p>
                <p>It is worth noting that 52 participants declined to participate in the trial
(<xref rid="fig5-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The
most common reason for this was patients not wanting to potentially delay their
debond appointment and being randomised to the Memotain<sup>®</sup> arm of the
trial.</p>

              <sec id="section34-14653125221118935">
                <title>Stability</title>
                <p>It is interesting to note that despite the failure rates, the increase in
irregularity, as measured with Little’s Irregularity Index, was minimal in the
majority of cases. While there were isolated cases of clinically relevant
relapse, in the majority of cases the retainers could be repaired or re-bonded
before any unwanted tooth movement occurred. The main consequence of the
retainer failures in this study was therefore the time, cost and inconvenience
of repairing the retainer. This ranged from simply re-bonding an individual
tooth back to the wire to complete replacement of the retainer on rare
occasions. In the instances where spacing occurred, active appliances had to be
placed for re-treatment (<xref rid="fig7-14653125221118935" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>).</p>
                <p>Stability was also assessed by measuring changes in intercanine width in both
arches. Both types of retainers were relatively successful at maintaining the
intercanine width. There was a slight increase in relapse in the intercanine
width in the lower arch when using the Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainer. However,
this was exceptionally small—only a 0.2-mm difference after six months—which is
not clinically significant.</p>

                <title>Patient satisfaction</title>
                <p>It is difficult conclude with any degree of confidence which retainer type
patients prefer, due to the very low levels of dissatisfaction with either
retainer. It is perhaps safest to conclude that at six months, patients were
satisfied with both types of retainers in terms of keeping the teeth straight,
the retainers being easy to look after, being comfortable and not affecting
speech.</p>
                <p>Of patients, 26% reported that the upper Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers caused a
problem that meant they needed to see their orthodontist. This is fewer than the
number of patients who had failure of their upper retainer, suggesting that many
of the failures went unnoticed by the patient, and highlighting the importance
of regular bonded retainer review appointments within the first six months of
placement. It would appear that it is not sufficient to presume that patients
will recognise when there has been a failure of the bonding or integrity of the
bonded retainer. If they are checked clinically, it may be possible to recognise
and repair or replace a bonded retainer before any clinically significant
relapse occurs.</p>

                <title>Cost-effectiveness not assessed in this trial</title>
                <p>Due to the termination of the trial, we were unable to assess the
cost-effectiveness of the two types of retainers. As one retainer is produced in
advance via an external lab and the other is fitted directly at the chairside,
there is a difference in the cost of the two retainers (with
Memotain<sup>®</sup> approximately 10 times more expensive). The amount of
clinical time may also be different between the two retainers, which may also
influence the overall cost. In future studies comparing lab-made retainers with
retainers bonded directly at the chairside, it would be helpful to include
cost-effectiveness as one of the outcomes.</p>

                <title>Comparisons to previous research</title>
                <p>Previous randomised controlled clinical trials investigating Memotain<sup>®</sup>
have all been in the mandibular arch (<xref rid="bibr2-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Adanur-Atmaca et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Alrawas et al., 2021</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr9-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Kartal et al.,
2021</xref>). The present study agrees with the findings of these studies,
that the failure rates are lower in the mandibular arch, and levels of stability
are good with mandibular retainers. This study provides new information on the
use of Memotain<sup>®</sup> in the upper arch, indicating that failure rates are
much higher when used palatally in the upper labial segment.</p>
                <p>There had previously been a shortage of high-quality research investigating
Ortho-FlexTech™ bonded retainers, so this trial provides some useful information
on stability, failure rates and patient satisfaction.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Due to the high number of problems with the upper Memotain<sup>®</sup> retainers,
the trial had to be stopped before the full sample size could be reached. It is
therefore possible that the failure to show any difference between the retainers
in some of the outcomes may be due to this smaller sample size. Interpretation
of the findings should therefore be done with caution.</p>
                <p>It was not possible to blind the operator or patient to the type of retainer
placed, which may have introduced bias. However, the outcome assessor was
successfully blinded.</p>
                <p>Patient satisfaction is a complex area and can be difficult to measure. In this
study, the questionnaire used the most relevant questions from a previous study
(<xref rid="bibr8-14653125221118935" ref-type="bibr">Forde et al.,
2018</xref>). Further researchers may want to design and validate a
questionnaire designed specifically for orthodontic retainers based on
qualitative research.</p>
                <p>The study was stopped after six months; therefore, it is important to note these
findings are over a relatively short period. The information on problems of some
of the retainers in the short term is certainly useful for clinicians. However,
as retainers are now often recommended for long-term use, longer-term follow-up
of retainers would be helpful.</p>

undertaken in a variety of settings (University, Hospital and Specialist
Practice) and by different grades of clinicians (Consultant, Orthodontic
Registrar and Orthodontic Therapist), which may make the findings more
generalisable; however, the reduced sample size means the results should be
viewed with caution. The wide range of confidence intervals in <xref rid="table2-14653125221118935" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> does seem to
suggest that individual variation is large, and the individual clinical skills
of different operators may have a significant effect on the failure rates.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>After six months of maxillary and mandibular retention with Memotain<sup>®</sup> and
Ortho-FlexTech™ bonded retainers, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p>
              <list list-type="order" id="list4-14653125221118935">
                <list-item>
                  <p>The trial had to be terminated early due to the high failure rate (50%) of
upper Memotain<sup>®</sup> bonded retainers within six months. The risk of
failure was approximately three times higher than Ortho-FlexTech™ bonded
retainers in the upper arch but the difference was not significantly
different (HR, 95% CI).</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>There was no difference in the risk of retainer failure between
Memotain<sup>®</sup> bonded retainers and Ortho-FlexTech™ in the lower
arch within six months.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>There was a high overall patient satisfaction with both types of bonded
retainers.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>All of these conclusions are based on a reduced sample size due to the termination of
the trial and should therefore be interpreted with caution.</p>
