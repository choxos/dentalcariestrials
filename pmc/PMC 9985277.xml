                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Alternatively to conventional treatments, chemo-mechanical caries removal agents can be used. A modality of treatment that has been increasing in dentistry is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> is being researched for application in aPDT. This protocol aims to determine the effectiveness of aPDT with <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> extract in deep caries lesions.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A total of 160 teeth with deep occlusal dental caries will be selected and divided into 4 groups: G1 - control group (Caries removal with a low-speed drill); G2 - Partial Caries Removal with Papacarie™ (Fórmula e Ação, São Paulo, SP, Brazil); G3 - Partial Caries Removal with Papacarie™ and application <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> extract (20%) (Fórmula e Ação, São Paulo, SP, Brazil); G4 - Partial Caries Removal with Papacarie™ and application <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> extract (20%) with LED (Valo Cordless Ultradent®, South Jordan, UT, USA) (aPDT). After treatment, all the teeth will be restored with glass ionomer cement and followed up clinically and radiographically, with evaluations at immediately, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Dentin samples before and after treatment will be analyzed microbiologically. The efficacy of treatments will be assessed with microbiological (colony-forming units, before and after carious tissue removal), radiographic (integrity of the periapical area and eventual changes in the radiolucent zones), and clinical examinations (retention of the restorative material in the cavity and occurrence of secondary caries), as well as with the time required for the procedures and the need for anesthesia during the procedures. In case data distribution is normal, analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used for both the dependent and independent variables. In case the data distribution is not normal, the Friedman test will be used for the dependent variables. For independent variables, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Procedures using aPDT have been developed for the treatment of dental caries, but there are few controlled clinical trials in the literature confirming its efficacy.</p>

                <p id="Par15">The minimally invasive clinical treatment is considered an approach to the treatment of tooth decay, which acts on detection, diagnosis, interception, and treatment at the microscopic level. The partial removal of dental caries in order to maintain the integrity of the pulp is currently considered the treatment of choice for deep carious lesions, provided that some diagnostic principles are respected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par16">Currently, the treatment of these lesions is done with the removal of carious tissue using burs, hand excavators, or other techniques. Alternatively, chemo-mechanical caries removal agents can be used instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Papacarie ™ is considered a minimally invasive clinical treatment approach to treating dental caries with proven efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is a papain-based gel employing natural enzymes extracted from papaya husk that promotes the softening of the dentin. The gel acts upon the contaminated dentin and has an effect on local bacteria, as well as being biocompatible and having neutral pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, it is necessary to improve its antimicrobial action. Clinical studies conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Papacarie™ (Fórmula e Ação, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) attribute its efficacy to its physical-chemical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Partial caries removal by the Papacarie™ is capable of effectively dissolving the structure of caries-infected dentin through cysteine protease enzymatic action with additional bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par17">This approach has been increasing in dentistry, being associated with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The use of red/yellowish dyes is being researched for their application in aPDT. <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> is a plant native to Brazil. From its seeds, it is possible to extract a dye, popularly known as “urucum.” This dye has important antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and recent studies have shown its potential as a photosensitizer in aPDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to its positive characteristics, especially regarding the lack of mutagenic and cytotoxic activity and antimicrobial effect, the <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> extract (Fórmula e Ação, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) could be considered a suitable candidate as a photosensitizer. Using a dye with these characteristics would make aPDT more accessible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par18">There are no controlled clinical trials in the literature that confirm the effectiveness of this type of therapy on deep caries-affected dentin associating Papacarie™ and aPDT with <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> extract, especially in the deep caries lesion. The justification for performing the treatment with Papacarie™ associated with aPDT using the <italic>Bixa orellana</italic> extract is to reduce the risk of pulp exposure in permanent teeth and increase the antimicrobial activity.</p>

Consequently, the microbiological evaluation had been chosen as the primary outcome. However, factors such as the radiological exam and the clinical aspects are also important for the control section, to show the presence or lack of success.

                  <p id="Par89">This is one of the primary outcomes of the study. A sample of caries-affected dentin will be taken from each selected tooth before the removal of the carious tissue. The samples will be standardized with the use of a Meyhoefer auricular curette n° 2 (ABC Instrumentos Cirúrgicos, São Paulo, Brazil), because it has a hole in its tip, and placed into test tubes containing 3.8 ml of the transport medium (Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, EUA).

                  <p id="Par90">Aliquots (100 ml) from each dilution will be sewn onto the surface of agar and spread with the aid of a Drigalski spatula. Undiluted aliquots and aliquots from dilution 10<sup>2</sup> (100 ml) will be pour-plated on Rogosa SL agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan) for the determination of lactobacilli (LB). The Brucella agar dishes will be incubated in an anaerobic chamber (PLAS by LABS, Lansing, MI) at 37°C for 7 days. The Mitis Salivarius agar and Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin dishes will be incubated in a 10% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse, Shel Lab, mod. 2123, Oregon) at 37°C for 48 h. The dishes containing Rogosa agar will be incubated in a 10% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C for 72 h. After incubation, the characteristic colonies in each dish will be counted with the aid of a stereomicroscope at a magnification of 10 times in dilutions with 30 to 300 colonies per dish. All procedures will be performed in duplicate, and the mean of the counts will be calculated. The results will be expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) of SM and LB as well as in proportion of streptococcus (% S/VM), SM group (% SM/VM and lactobacilli (% LB/VM) in relation to the total of viable microorganisms (VM). For SM, the proportion in relation to the total of streptococci (% SM/S) will also be calculated. Immediately after the removal of the carious tissue, samples of the remaining dentin will be taken with a Meyhoefer auricular n° 2 curette and the procedures will be repeated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Radiographic evaluation</title>
                  <p id="Par91">This is one of the primary outcomes of the study. The radiographic examinations will be carried out in the following manner: (1) periapical radiographs will be used as a diagnostic aid; (2) after the incomplete removal of the demineralized dentine and the temporary filling of cavity, a bitewing radiograph it will be taken to allow the analysis of the radiolucent zone (RZ), that is, the amount of demineralized dentine left; (3) immediately, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, periapical and bitewing radiographs will be taken to analyze the integrity of the periapical area and the eventual changes in the RZ.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">To obtain geometric standardization of films, bitewing film holders will be used. The images obtained before and after the treatment will be digitized by a ScanJet 6100 scanner Hewllet-Packard (OR, USA). The images will be stored in maximum-quality JPG format. The Imagelab software (version 2.3, SoftiumSistemas de Informatica, São Paulo, Brazil) will be used to analyze the images (equalize and subtract). Change in the density measurement of the RZ during treatment will be evaluated blind through digital subtraction of radiographic images in relation to the initial exams in the experimental periods (immediately, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months).</p>
                  <p id="Par93">The radiographic subtraction process will consist of comparing two images. By definition, a digital subtraction image from a site where no change in density has occurred would show a complete cancelation of all anatomical structures, eliminating the constant structures present in both. Any change in the structures indicates a change in density. This method requires standardized radiographs regarding the X-ray projection, exposure time, film, and development. Nonetheless, the procedures will be standardized; radiographs will be performed at different moments, which causes them to have different densities. To correct for any changes in density, the gray-level histograms of the two images will be compared and adjusted using a nonparametric contrast correction algorithm. The image radiograph equalization will be done in the following way: the radiograph taken immediately after the treatment and the one taken after each period of treatment (immediately, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) will be placed beside one another on the computer screen. The radiograph that shows the best distribution of gray tonalities on the histogram will be chosen as a model, and the other image will be equalized according to the model.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">The subtraction will be carried out the following way: the radiograph taken immediately after the treatment and the images obtained after each of the experimental periods will be overlapped. The anatomic details of the two images will be matched by rotation or moving the images horizontally or vertically. The radiolucent zone beneath the restoration and two control areas (CA1 and CA2) will be selected. The control areas will be dentinal areas (mesial and distal) close to the RZ. The difference in radiographic density between the two radiographs will be determined for each selected area using a gray tonalities scale. There are 256 individual shades of gray in an 8-bit pixel going from 0 (black) to 255 (white). This is the pixel’s grayscale resolution. An average gray level value of 128 (the middle of the digitizer gray level range set by the software) would show up at each pixel. Areas with gray levels &lt;128 in the subtraction image would indicate a loss in density and gray levels &gt;128 would indicate an increase in density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
