                <p>Giving dental chews to dogs is part of the passive homecare that helps prevent the formation of plaque and tartar. The objectives of these studies were to assess the effectiveness of a vegetable-based dental chew (VF) to maintain oral health, and to compare it to 2 different reference chews (RC) with a proven effectiveness. The first study was conducted on 45 small dogs (&lt;10 kg) and the second on 60 larger dogs (15-30 kg) who were randomly assigned to 3 different groups. During 30 days, one group received no chew (control) while the second and third group received either one RC (RC1 or RC2) or one VF per day. All dogs had their teeth scaled on Day 0. On Day 30, scores were given for plaque and calculus. Gingival parameters were also assessed. Statistical analysis (analysis of variance and Tukey tests ± Bonferroni's adjustment) were performed to compare groups with <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> set at .05 for significance.</p>
                <p>The 3 types of chews were found to be efficacious to reduce plaque and calculus formation and the gingival bleeding compared to control (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05). There was no significant difference between RCs and VF in both trials except for the gingival bleeding parameters which showed a greater improvement with VF. Therefore, daily administration of the VF is effective to reduce plaque and calculus formation and gingival bleeding and has a better efficacy on gingival bleeding than the other reference products tested. It can therefore be used with confidence at home for preventative dental care.</p>

              <p>Periodontal disease is the most prevalent oral disease in dogs and cats.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It has been under the attention of clinicians and researchers not only to find its etiopathogenesis and treatment but also to provide preventive care. Prevention strategies of periodontal disease are focused on control of accumulation of dental deposits, namely dental plaque and calculus. Such control can be achieved by oral homecare, which is further divided into active (involving direct interaction between owner and pet), and passive modalities. Without a doubt, the most efficient methods are active (like tooth brushing), however the compliance of owners performing this type of hygiene is low, with an overall rate of 1%.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This fact has led to the development of passive homecare modalities, which include dental diets, treats, chews, water additives, and nutritional supplements. Moreover, because of the low compliance for tooth brushing, passive homecare may be superior to active homecare simply due to the fact that it is actually performed.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There are numerous products available, but only a few have scientific evidence that they produce any health benefit. Therefore, it is recommended that veterinary professionals review the literature to determine for themselves whether or not to recommend a particular product.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC), a nonregulatory agency which includes representatives from professional dental colleges as well as allied veterinary groups, provides an objective means of recognizing commercially available products that meet preset standards of effectiveness in controlling accumulation of dental plaque and calculus (tartar) in dogs and cats.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The daily addition of dental chews and treats was proven to reduce plaque and calculus accumulation as well as gingivitis and halitosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="bibr6-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Even among the available products that have been awarded the VOHC seal, there are differences in palatability, prescriptions, and effectiveness. A growing number of food allergies and/or intolerances increases the need for developing products which will carry lower risk of such side effects.</p>
              <p>The vegetable-based dental chew tested (VEGGIEDENT® FR3SH™, Virbac; called VF) has been shown to be safe,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> totally soluble in vitro by digestive enzymes,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> palatable<sup><xref rid="bibr13-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and efficient in reducing bad breath according to owners.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The objectives of the 2 studies were: (1) to assess the effectiveness of this VF in reducing plaque and calculus formation and in limiting gingival bleeding in owner's dogs and (2) to compare its effectiveness to reference chews (RCs) that have a proven effectiveness in the reduction of both plaque and calculus accumulation, according to the VOHC seal awarded.</p>
              <p>The unicentric, randomized, single-blinded, controlled studies were performed with the use of the following indices measuring the oral health status: plaque index (PI), calculus index (CI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), and oral health index (OHI). The Total Mouth Periodontal Score-Gingivitis (TMPS-G) was also calculated.</p>
              <p>The 2 studies were conducted on dogs of different sizes and the comparison was made with a different RC in each study.</p>

                <p>Animals included in the study were client-owned and all procedures performed during the study were conducted according to standard veterinary care procedures and following Polish Regulations (Art.1 ust.2 pkt1 Dz. U.2015 poz. 266). The studies were approved by an ethical committee (Approbation numbers: EU-ERC/201805-04 for trial 1 and EU-ERC/201902-04 for trial 2).</p>
                <p>To be included, dogs had to be in good general health and have mild to moderate gingivitis (Gingivitis index ≤ 2). All teeth to be scored (maxilla: I3, C, P3, P4, Ml and mandible: C, P3, P4, Ml) had to be present, with no sign of periodontal disease greater than second stage (PD2).</p>
                <p>All animals participating underwent qualification for anesthesia including a physical examination as well as blood and urine collection. If qualified, the dogs were anesthetized and professional teeth cleaning procedure performed. Owners accepted all of the above procedures by signing a consent form.</p>
                <p>For trial 1, 45 dogs weighing less than 10 kg were recruited (24 Jack Russell terriers and 21 Miniature Schnauzer dogs) while, for trial 2, 60 dogs weighing between 15 and 30 kg were recruited. Dogs in the latter group belonged to 15 different breeds, mainly Alaskan Huskies (17), Greysters (13), and Greenland dogs (9).</p>

                <p>The dogs received one of the chews cited above (or none) for 30 days. On Day 0, all animals had a general physical examination including visual assessment, heart and lung auscultation, capillary refill time assessment, body weight measurement, general body condition score, and body temperature measurements. Additionally, an oral examination was performed on awake animals to qualify dogs for the trial and included the check for the presence of required teeth and periodontal status. Blood and urine were collected for immediate laboratory work (general biochemistry, hematology, urine analysis) and an intravenous catheter was inserted into the cephalic vein. Laboratory results were used to assess suitability for anesthesia. Sedation was performed with the use of medetomidine and butorphanol at recommended doses followed by preoxygenation with an oxygen mask. After sedation was achieved, the animal received propofol at recommended doses for induction of general anesthesia. An endotracheal tube was then placed and cuff filled according to the size of the dog and tube. Fluid therapy was introduced with Ringer's solution at standard infusion rates. During anesthesia, cardio-respiratory functions were monitored. A temperature maintenance system was also put in place. After dental procedures were done, the animal was allocated to an Intensive Care Unit cage with oxygen supply and received medication to reverse sedation.</p>
                <p>The comprehensive oral health assessment and treatment consisted of: dental charting, full mouth radiography, a professional dental cleaning procedure under general anesthesia and with endotracheal tube placed, scaling and polishing of the teeth. Scaling effectiveness was evaluated by use of a disclosing solution to ensure that all plaque and calculus were removed. If unsuccessful, the scaling and polishing procedure was repeated.</p>
                <p>On Day 30, the veterinarian assessed the animal before sedation (same drugs and doses as on Day 0) and oral assessment was performed by one scorer who is an experienced researcher in the periodontal field and a board certified specialist in veterinary dentistry (JG).</p>
                <p>The oral assessment methods for gingivitis, plaque, and calculus were applied to the following 9 (5 + 4) target teeth: Maxilla—I3, C, P3, P4, M1; Mandible—C, P3, P4, and M1. The entire buccal surface of the target teeth on both sides of the mouth was scored by an experienced scorer who evaluated all 3 parameters in the following order: GBI, plaque, and calculus indices. The scores obtained for each tooth were then averaged to obtain a mean mouth score per dog, for each parameter.</p>
                <p>The GBI<sup><xref rid="bibr17-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> was first scored as follows: 0 = no inflammation; 1 = mild inflammation; 2 = Moderate inflammation, and 3 = Severe inflammation. The PI was scored with Modified Logan &amp; Boyce index<sup><xref rid="bibr18-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> with the use of plaque disclosing solution (IC plaque, IM3) to score coverage and thickness of the plaque. Plaque was brushed from the surface of the teeth prior to calculus coverage assessment. Finally CI<sup><xref rid="bibr19-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> was evaluated with the use of a dental explorer.</p>
                <p>The OHI<sup><xref rid="bibr20-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> was assigned as the sum of 4 scores related to: lymph node condition (0: normal; 1: slightly enlarged; 2: moderate to significantly enlarged); dental lesion and gingivitis (0: none; 1: presence of gingivitis; 2: periodontitis); plaque (0: none; 1: up to 50% of dental crown surface; 2: &gt; 50% of dental crown surface) and tartar (0: none; 1: up to 50% of dental crown surface; 2: &gt; 50% of dental crown surface).</p>
                <p>Finally, the TMPS-G (TMPS-G based on GBI) was calculated to have an idea of the gingivitis and periodontitis extent. This method adjusts the GBI to the size of teeth and size of dog.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The percentage of change seen between Day 0 and Day 30 was calculated for OHI and TMPS-G scores by reporting the difference of scores obtained on Day 30 and Day 0 to the score obtained on Day 0 [(score on Day 30−score on Day 0)/score on Day 0] for each individual.</p>

              <p>By assessing different oral and dental indices, this study showed that chewing a dental chew of good quality can reduce the accumulation of plaque and calculus in dogs after dental scaling. It also showed that it could help reduce the GBI and improve the oral health and periodontal score for gingivitis indices. Overall, these data show that the daily addition of the tested dental chews helps maintain dog's oral health.</p>
              <p>These data are consistent with previous findings showing similar effects of different dental chews or sticks.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="bibr4-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The main beneficial effect of those products is achieved by the chewing action which allows tartar and plaque to be scraped away. Therefore, it is mostly effective on the chewing (caudal) teeth and should complement an active homecare (tooth brushing) which is, on the contrary, most effective on front teeth that are easier to access.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Additionally, the action of chewing stimulates saliva production which, when combined with the mechanical forces applied to the dental surfaces, helps flush away debris, food remnants and helps to detach deposits.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Active and passive homecare are necessary to maintain good oral health. Scaling dog's teeth, although highly effective, is not sufficient to keep the dog's mouth healthy on a long term basis, as plaque can form in 24h, calculus in 3 days and gingivitis can start in 2 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Indices that assess gingiva, plaque, and calculus do not provide clear characterization of oral health. The addition of OHI to clinical observations intended to assess whether the reduction of dental deposits was indeed consistent with an improvement of the oral condition. In both studies, all parameters (GBI, plaque, calculus scores, and OHI) were improved with the chews, suggesting a good correlation between these parameters. Although usually measured on larger populations, OHI can still illustrate the oral situation even in smaller groups as in the present studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In the 2 studies presented here, the VF chew was compared to 2 other dental chews known to have an effect on both plaque and calculus accumulation based on the VOHC seal awarded for these 2 parameters. This chew (Veggiedent® FR3SH™) performed as well, if not better, than the RCs on all parameters tested. It was shown to be as efficient as the RCs in reducing plaque and calculus accumulation and to be even more efficient than the RC2 (and RC1, though not in a significant manner after applying the Bonferroni's correction) in reducing GBI on day 30. Furthermore, the results on TMPS-G confirmed the superiority of VF towards RC2 and also showed the superiority of VF towards RC1, when assessing the evolution of this parameter from Day 0 to Day 30. Compared to GBI, TMPS-G adjusts the GBI to the size of each tooth and the size of the dog and is then more adapted to each individual than the GBI itself. Therefore, the tested chew (VF) given daily seems to provide a better preventative measure for gingival bleeding than the 2 other RCs tested. The data on oral indices obtained with VF are consistent with a previous study made with a similar chew.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-08987564211054225" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It has to be noted, though, that a variability may have existed between groups in terms of dental deposit accumulation since no stratification based on this parameter was performed before allocation into groups. A pretrial measurement of the rate of deposition of plaque and/or calculus to then allocate evenly the dogs in the different groups based on this parameter would have limited this variability.</p>
              <p>This article provides, for the first time, a comparison of different chews to maintain good oral health in dogs and emphasizes the need for home dental care in prevention of periodontal disease. It also highlights the possible differences between the chews and the necessity to find the right product to use. The finding that the Veggiedent® FR3SH™ chew provides better prevention of gingivitis is of importance for dogs that are prone to develop gingivitis and periodontal disease. Furthermore, the lack of common food allergens and animal derivatives in this veterinary chew also appears as an additional benefit for patients who suffer from food intolerance or allergies.</p>
              <p>Finally, in both studies, the chews were given after a professional dental scaling in order to assess their preventive effectiveness on plaque and calculus accumulation and the consequent effect on gingival bleeding. Although never assessed, it is unlikely that a chew itself could improve oral health without a proper and regular professional dental cleaning.</p>
              <p>Therefore, adding a daily dental chew should become part of the oral health strategy for the patient together with other modalities and regular (annually or more frequently if required) dental controls by professionals.</p>
              <p>Delivering several hygienic homecare methods simultaneously does not necessarily ensure life-long oral health and thus clinical follow-up is mandatory.</p>
