                  <p id="Par1">The data on polyetheretherketone (PEEK) influence on the peri-implant soft tissues in clinical settings are deficient. The aims of this pilot study were to analyze and compare soft tissues’ response to PEEK and titanium (Ti) healing abutments (HA) by means of histological and immunohistochemical analyses.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A total of 22 implants with PEEK or Ti HA were placed in 11 patients, applying the “split-mouth” study design. Three months later, soft tissue specimens were harvested from 20 implants for histology in order to qualitatively detect the inflammatory cells’ presence, to semi-qualitatively analyze the inflammation intensity and to assess the inflammatory responses type by immunohistochemical analysis using LCA, CD3, CD20 and CD68 antibodies.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Epithelial infiltrate followed by an intensive inflammation in sub-epithelium was observed in 100% around PEEK HA. A number of LCA+ and CD 68+ cells was significantly higher in PEEK comparing to Ti group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.020, respectively), while CD 20+ and CD3+ counted cells were found in a significantly higher amount in Ti than in PEEK group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.010, respectively).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">PEEK HA seems to evoke the more intense tissue inflammatory response demonstrated predominantly by histocytes’ and plasmacytes’ activation, while Ti HA triggers the inflammatory reaction of lower intensity, dominantly mediated by B-cells.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par11">Titanium dental implants have been thoroughly analyzed over the past decades and have become the treatment of choice for the replacement of the missing teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although high survival rates have been documented, possible complications remain an issue. In spite of differing literature data on peri-implantitis prevalence (from 11 to 47%), most of the studies confirmed that complications may affect around 10% of implants and 20% of patients after 5 to 10 years of dental implants in function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, the need for peri-implantitis prevention on each level is crucial.</p>
              <p id="Par12">A need for an improvement of both osseointegration and peri-implant soft tissue seal maintenance exist so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Alongside osseointegration process, the peri-implant soft tissue maturation occurs, resulting in an establishment of a barrier epithelium (mucosal seal) and a connective tissue attachment to the implant surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Peri-implant soft tissues are fundamental, acting as a biologic seal between bone and the oral cavity and a barrier to the contamination of implant surface by pathogenic flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The importance of inflammation-free mucosal seal and connective tissue barrier, as well as maintenance of a long-lasting physical and structural boundary between the soft tissue and implant collar or abutment surface have been more recently pointed as critical factors in peri-implant health and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">In respect to the previously mentioned fact, the selection of the abutment material could play one of the essential roles in the soft tissue seal stability and subsequent marginal bone integrity. Therefore, an abutment material should be less prone to biofilm adhesion, and act preventively in terms of soft tissue inflammation. Commonly, implant abutments are made of titanium (Ti); nonetheless, innovative materials such as ceramics and polymers have been introduced in prosthetic implant dentistry. One of the materials more recently imported in implant dentistry is a polymer polyetheretherketone (PEEK), whose pioneer application was in orthopedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], showing a beneficial property in terms of lower Young’s (elastic) modulus (3–4 GPa), close to the human bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">PEEK is a synthetic, tooth colored (white) thermoplastic polymeric material with numerous favorable properties, such as good mechanical characteristics and chemical inertness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, PEEK is still categorized as bioinert owing to its low integration with surrounding tissues, as opposed to titanium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been used in dental implantology and prosthodontics as healing abutment, temporary abutment and for various frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] .</p>
              <p id="Par15">In an in vitro settings, it has been shown that PEEK should perform equally to commercially pure titanium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and that biofilm formation on the surface of PEEK is comparable or lower than on the surface of conventionally applied abutment materials such as zirconia and titanium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another laboratory findings revealed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced significantly more proinflammatory cytokines when exposed to the PEEK surface compared to the Ti-6 aluminum-4 vanadium surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the authors of the more recent animal study evaluated the soft tissue response to dental implant closure caps made of PEEK or Ti by the occurrence of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). Significantly more MNGCs were in contact with PEEK than with Ti closure caps, suggesting a more prominent soft tissue response around PEEK closure caps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current scientific literature lacks clinical data to confirm these observations. Additionally, the literature information on soft tissue response on the PEEK surface, as well as the influence of PEEK on the peri-implant soft tissue interface in the clinical settings are deficient.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Since PEEK has an increasing popularity as a material used in oral implantology and given the fact the scarce scientific evidence lies behind its interactions with the surrounding tissues, the objectives of this pilot clinical study were to assess and thoroughly analyze the soft tissue profile around PEEK healing abutments on osseointegrated implants. Specifically, the primary aim of present study was to histologically analyze and compare soft tissues’ response to PEEK and Ti material, while the secondary aim was further elaboration of the nature of these tissue reactions by means of immunohistochemical analyses.</p>

                <p id="Par17">This study was conducted at the Department of Periodontology and Oral medicine of the Belgrade School of Dental Medicine in collaboration with the Institute of Pathology of the Belgrade Faculty of Medicine. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (36/28). All the subjects enrolled in this study signed an informed consent and all methods were performed in accordance with the Helsinki declaration of 1964. and subsequent amendments.</p>
                <p id="Par18">This was an observational pilot clinical trial, with a “split-mouth” design. It was conducted as an integral part of the further study still in progress, comprising larger number of patients.

                <title>Study sample</title>
                <p id="Par19">The subjects included in this study were recruited from the patients of the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade. Individuals diagnosed with partial edentulism in posterior maxillary or mandibular arches, with healed sites and missing at least one tooth on each side of the jaw were selected, following clinical and radiological examination.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The data obtained from all patients were registered in case record forms created for the needs of this research. Clinical periodontal parameters such as periodontal probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque index (PI) were recorded for each patient. One single calibrated examiner performed the measurements using a periodontal probe (UNC-15 Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL) in six points around every tooth. The available bone volume was evaluated, and implant diameter and length were planned according to the CBCT images (Cranex® 3D, Soredex, Tuusula, Finland).</p>
                <p id="Par21">A total of 11 patients requiring implant placement (with bilateral single tooth gaps and/or extended edentulous spaces distally from maxillary or mandibular canines) were enrolled in this study if fulfilling the inclusion criteria:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par22">Men and non-pregnant women, age 18 to 70;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Systemically healthy patients;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">An adequate bone quantity allowing for the insertion of 3.8 mm or 4.3-mm diameter implants;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">At least 2 mm of keratinized mucosa at the experimental sites;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">No active periodontal disease at the time of inclusion/surgery and proper oral hygiene defined by bleeding on probing scores (BOP) and plaque indices (PI) less than 15%.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Surgical procedure</title>
                <p id="Par27">A single trained surgeon (Z.A.) performed all implant placement procedures under local anesthesia (2% lidocaine with epinephrine, 1:100000). Mid-crestal incisions extended through the sulci of adjacent teeth were made and full-thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated with caution not to interfere with muco-gingival junction. Surgical implant sites were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using drills of increasing dimeters, with a low-trauma surgical technique under a copious irrigation with sterile physiological saline. Thereafter, two bone level implants were inserted (C-TECH Esthetic line (EL), Italy) up to 1 mm subcrestally, with a single-stage protocol.</p>

Test and control abutments (C-TECH, San Pietro in Casale (BO), Italy) were provided in width of 4.3 mm and in different heights (2, 3, or 4 mm), selected in relation to gingival height.</p>
                <p id="Par29">A surgeon (Z.A.), not previously involved in the patient selection, randomly assigned participants following simple randomization procedures to either test or control group. The randomized codes were enclosed in sequentially numbered, identical, sealed envelopes. Following the “split-mouth” study design, implant abutments from randomly chosen group was placed on one jaw side, while the abutment from the remaining group was screwed on the contralateral side of the same jaw (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the group A, immediately after the implant insertion, a PEEK abutment was screwed, while in the group B, the same procedure was performed using Ti HA. All abutments were connected using a torque of 10 Ncm. Finally, the mucoperiosteal flaps were repositioned and adapted using non-resorbable single sutures to ensure a primary wound closure and transmucosal healing.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Clinical presentation of PEEK and Ti healing abutments placed after the surgery within the split-mouth protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2022_2536_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

The use of avidin-biotin interaction in immuno-enzymatic techniques provides a simple and sensitive method to localize antigens in formalin-fixed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The primary antibodies used in this study were: LCA (M3629Clone 318–6-11, dilution 1:25; Dako, positive control tonsil tissue), CD 3 (M3539 Clone β-catenin1, dilution 1:200; Dako, positive control tonsil tissue), CD 20 (M7240 Clone MIB-1, dilution 1:100; Dako, positive control tonsil tissue), and CD 68 (EPR2241, ab134175, dilution 1:200; Abcam, positive control tonsil tissue). Since CD3 is expressed in all stages of T lymphocytes differentiation, this marker was used to identify both cytotoxic T and T helper cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par44">The results of the present study indicated the more pronounce soft tissue inflammatory reaction around PEEK HA, mirrored in an intensive sub-epithelium infiltrate around all PEEK HA. Additionally, LCA+ and CD 68+ cells dominated in PEEK group, while the number of CD 20+ and CD3+ cells was significantly higher around Ti HA.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Despite being a biologically inert material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], earlier animal studies connected PEEK implantation to some inflammatory cells’ infiltration, occasionally with macrophages and foreign body giant cells, indicating mild chronical inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Only few laboratory studies on animal model have investigated soft tissue response to PEEK surface, with somewhat opposing remarks. While one study concluded that the use of PEEK HA may be indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], another demonstrated the significantly higher occurrence of multi-nucleated giant cells in contact with PEEK than with Ti closure caps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, available literature data provide no information based on histological and immunohistochemical analyses of soft tissue interaction with PEEK in clinical settings.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Although soft tissue specimens were obtained from peri-implant soft tissue without clinically recognizable signs of inflammation, qualitative and semi-quantitative histological analyses demonstrated the presence of sub-epithelial inflammatory infiltrate around both PEEK and Ti HA, yet more pronounced around PEEK. Furthermore, leukocyte epithelial invasion was also observed in all specimens from PEEK group, less around Ti. Similar epithelial tropism in clinically healthy tissues has been previously reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">The sample examination in the present study showed the mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisted predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells and tissue histiocytes. The inflammatory response comparative analysis demonstrated the more intense inflammation display in the soft tissue surrounding PEEK, which reflected in significantly higher number of LCA+ and CD68+ cells around this material in comparison to Ti. It has been pointed out earlier that macrophages were the first cells coming in contact with implanted biomaterials, acting as important modulators of tissue biomaterial integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The observations of the present study might be in line with previous animal research that reported the heling abutment material influenced the multi-nucleated giant cells number, i.e. the PEEK closure caps surroundings had more of these cells than Ti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is important to emphasize that multi-nucleated giant cells are formed as a result of monocytes/macrophages fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent immunohistochemical clinical study indicated that macrophages were considerably present in inflammatory infiltrate at peri-implantitis sites, suggesting their ability to increase peri-implant pocket depth following the tissue invasion, to disrupt the soft tissue adaptation and to enable bacterial invasion into the peri-implant tissue compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the higher number of CD68+ cells observed in present study around PEEK closure caps might possibly be considered a risk factor for peri-implant pocket deepening, having in mind that a total bacterial load around PEEK was demonstrated to be higher than around Ti, although insignificantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Indeed, PEEK HA is present in the mouth only temporarily and relatively shortly to eventually participate in the establishment of peri-implantitis lesions. However, having in mind the above-mentioned ability of CD68+ cells to deepen the peri-implant pocket, their higher number around PEEK found in present study might be cautiously recognized as a potential contributor to peri-implant disease, although studies with a specified methodology are needed to confirm this assumption.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Additionally, further lymphocyte phenotyping in present research confirmed the significant dominance of CD 20+ B cells in inflammatory infiltrate around Ti, as well as the statistically greater number of CD 3 + T-lymphocytes in peri-implant soft tissue in contact to Ti compared to PEEK. However, as mentioned before, a total inflammatory infiltrate around Ti healing caps was less dense in comparison to PEEK, which mirrored in significantly higher number of LCA+ cells around PEEK material. These observations corroborate with findings of earlier studies where the detection of CD3+ T-lymphocytes in peri-implant soft tissue signified a well-controlled local immune response in otherwise clinically healthy tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The finding of humoral immunity domination around Ti HA in present study is comparable to previous research where also B lymphocytes were identified in greater number in contrast to T lymphocytes in peri-implant soft tissue clinically free of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], even when comparing Ti and zirconia healing caps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Additionally, the larger population of CD20+ cells might indicate that more lymphocytes were sensitized and matured to become plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, since CD20 cannot target the last stage of B cells development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], further analyses are required to identify the presence of plasma cells.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Finally, it should be stressed out that despite the more pronounced inflammatory reaction was observed surrounding PEEK HA histologically, clinically soft tissues around both Ti and PEEK healing caps were free of inflammation at the moment of tissue specimens’ harvesting. Truly, BOP and PI values were significantly greater around PEEK HA at the time of biopsy, however with values up to 15%, clearly indicating the absence of clinically relevant soft tissue inflammation. Importantly, since this pilot study comprised a limited number of participants, only the further study conducted on a larger cohort of patients could confirm or contradict these results, including the observations made in present research on inflammatory cells’ profile detected. Furthermore, this study observed its subjects and placed implants during a three-month period, hence, no radiographic evaluation was performed. This limitation of the present study could be overcome in some future research with longer follow-up and radiographic assessment of a potential crestal bone changes.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par50">In conclusion, different HA materials generate different immunological response in the surrounding peri-implant soft tissues. The results of present study might lead to a conclusion that PEEK HA material encourages the more pronounced tissue inflammatory response demonstrated predominantly by histocytes’ and plasmacytes’ activation. On the other side, Ti triggers the inflammatory reaction of lower intensity, dominantly mediated by B-cells. The main limitation of the present study is the small sample size; therefore its findings should be interpreted with caution. The study continuation with greater sample size is needed to confirm the observations made in this pilot research.</p>
