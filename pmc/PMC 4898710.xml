                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cost, social acceptability and non-stringent regulations pertaining to smokeless tobacco (SLT) product sales have made people choose and continue using SLT. If disaggregated data on smokeless forms and smoked practices of tobacco are reviewed, the incidence of SLT remains static. There is a strong positive correlation of SLT intake with the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular disease, particularly in the low socioeconomic populations.</p>

                  <p>To investigate the prevalence of smokeless tobacco, its initiation influence and risk factors associated with the practice among lower socioeconomic populations of Bangladesh.</p>
                  <p>In this study, we explore the utilization of SLT among lower socioeconomic populations in industrialized zone of Bangladesh.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Almost fifty percent of the respondents initiated SLT usage at the age of 15–24 years and another 22 percent respondents were smoking and using SLT concurrently. The bulk of the women respondents used SLT during their pregnancy. Nearly twenty five percent of the respondents tried to quit the practice of SLT and one-quarter had a plan to quit SLT in the future. More than twenty percent respondents were suffering from dental decay. A noteworthy correlation was found by gender (p&lt;0.01), sufferings from SLT related disease (p&lt;0.05). The multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that, males were 2.7 times more knowledgeable than that of females (p&lt;0.01) about the adversative health condition of SLT usage. The respondents suffering from SLT related diseases were 3.7 times as more knowledgeable about the effect of the practice of SLT than the respondents without diseases (p&lt;0.01). Regarding the knowledge about the health consequences of the practice of SLT, one participant in the FGD session commented that “<italic>although the mouth is the gateway to health</italic>, <italic>we infected our mouth by using Zarda and Gul”</italic>. Again, informants opined that peer, family, curiosity and hospitality, culture are influencing factors for SLT initiation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 6 million people breathe their last every year as a consequence of use tobacco and SLT [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it is the mainly representing about 12% global mortality of adult [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Keeping all conditions constant the SLT consumption and the forecasted death tool will be nearly 10 million every year by the time 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The SLT habit is a main factor of death that can be avoidable [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Smokeless tobacco is in general health burden as the SLT epidemic is a greatest danger the world confronted ever. At present, utilization of tobacco makes 1 in 10 deaths among adults overall which trait above 5 million persons a year. Yearly fatalities from tobacco use will upsurge to additional 8 million by 2030, unless the critical move is made. In the event that present patterns hold on uncontrolled, it is estimated that around 500 million individuals active currently will be killed by tobacco. In this century, SLT may perhaps be the cause of deaths around a billion individuals [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This global agent of death kills up to half of its users, and this premature death of users deprive their families of income, raise the price of health care and hamper economic development comprehensively. Most ordinarily used SLT products incorporate—tobacco paan masala, tobacco with Chun (lime-calcium carbonate), and tobacco with pan and betel quid [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Customary structures like betel quid, tobacco with lime and tobacco tooth powder are usually used. SLT habit is the mainly preventable cause for unexpected loss and infection around the Earth, and this one consequence is significantly more affirmed in low-and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. South Asia is a noteworthy maker and a net exporter of tobacco. More than 33% of tobacco expended locally is smokeless. Tobacco leaf production has been expanding relentlessly and extensively, and has multiplied subsequent to 1960s [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The distribution of tobacco utilization is not even; it is excessively upper in lower socioeconomic clusters, poor and semi-gifted manual profession groups, unemployed and poor with no education.</p>
              <p>The practice of SLT is rampant in South East Asia. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 90% of SLT consumers live in South East Asia [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In south Asia, including Bangladesh traditional values do not permit smoking by women, however, the usages of SLT is socially acceptable. Tobacco used with betel leaf, mostly used variety of chewing tobacco, known as Paan in the subcontinent, it is commonly used after having food, snacks, tea in small and large social gatherings, as a cultural practice of Bangladeshi people which is extending back over the centuries [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The prevalence of SLT propensity is 27% (26 million grown-up individuals) with a comparable circulation crosswise over sexual orientations in Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Bangladesh, tobacco habit has become not only a major contributor to the country’s high morbidity, but also the biggest burden to the country’s economy [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several nationwide research in Bangladesh revealed the high occurrence of both smoking (e.g., cigarettes, <italic>bidis</italic>) and habit of SLT (e.g., betel quid with Gul, tobacco, <italic>khoini</italic>, <italic>Zorda</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Easy accessibility and affordability, along with misunderstandings concerning its useful health effects are main contributing elements for augmented smokeless tobacco consumption. While many people are aware that tobacco is hazardous, the majority of users are not aware about the lethal association between SLT and fatal diseases. The major health consequences related through SLT use include oral and dental diseases [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which disproportionately affects the poor. Besides, it is linked with a 2–4 times increase in the risk for cardiovascular diseases.</p>
              <p>The mortality hazard for ladies who expend SLT is greater than that for men. Utilization of SLT in pregnancy is connected to stillbirths and a 2–3 times higher danger of low conception weight babies. Other wellbeing impacts of SLT practice in corporate caries of tooth, subsiding of gums, hypertension, oral sub-mucous fibrosis (OSF), cancers of the mouth and food pipe etc. [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In Bangladesh is overburdened with tobacco-related illnesses; 57,000 people died in 2004 because of SLT related diseases. In one review by WHO, 9% of the members analyzed at families had no less than one of eight chose SLT related infections (ischemic coronary illness, lung growth, stroke, oral tumor, and malignancy of the larynx, endless obstructive pneumonic sickness, aspiratory tuberculosis or Buerger's ailment). Likewise, 41% of these were invariable from tobacco. The healing centre information showed that 29% of inpatients matured 30 years or above were hospitalized for the reason of infections.</p>
              <p>It was also estimated that they were responsible for 16% of all demises in the country and 9% of the cases were due to tobacco [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies from India [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Pakistan [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] report that many people believe that roughly the SLT products are beneficial to health, relieving toothache, headache, and stomachache. Accessibility of SLT products is an main environmental factor that influences tobacco initiation [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Generally, sun or air preserved SLT can be used by the person itself in unrefined, treated or factory-made form. It is used with lime, with Areca nut or in a betel quid (<italic>pan</italic>). The distribution of SLT intake is not uniform; it is excessively higher in lower socioeconomic clusters, poor, semi-skilled labor-intensive occupation clusters, unemployed and people with no education.</p>
              <p>Bangladesh is one of the main manufacturers of tobacco in the world, SLT products is used by men, women, adolescent and children. New forms of highly addictive packaged SLT goods such as <italic>Zorda</italic>, <italic>Gul</italic>, <italic>and Sadapatha</italic> are cheap and rates of use are higher in low-income urban communities</p>
              <p>So far we know no complete research on the initiation influence of the practice of SLT, the correlation between risk factors and the habit of SLT in Bangladesh. Due to lack of such data on SLT habit in Bangladesh, the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of smokeless tobacco, its initiation influence and risk factors associated with the practice among the low socio-economic populations of Bangladesh. This study covered two areas, viz. Demra and Tongi, adjacent to Dhaka Metropolitan city. These two adjacent areas of Dhaka were selected for the study as these are industrial areas and easily approachable. Traditionally, this cohort of population use smokeless tobacco higher than others (Gilani et al., 2013). Usually in industrial areas, low income people live and supposed to use smokeless tobacco more frequently than others.</p>

                <p>A detail investigation was accompanied prior to actual data gathering to classify the objective residents by sex. Enumeration checklist was developed to list entitled household participants. The checklist contained Line number, Name of the person, Relationship with household head, Gender, Education, Habit of SLT habit and Number of SLT users in the family. A sampling frame was constituted with this information stratified by sex. A systematic sampling technique was applied to get the target sample from this sampling frame.</p>

The questionnaire was pre-tested in a non-sample site in an industrial area within Dhaka city with a draft Bangla version of the instruments to get feedback on the suitability, appropriateness and sequencing of the questions. The study included 230 from Demra (115 males and 115 females) and 230from Tongi (115 males and 115 females) respectively for interview. The face-to-face interview technique was applied to collect data from the SLT users. For each eligible respondent’s a questionnaire including socio-demographic data for example Age, gender, level of education, marital status, occupation, Family History of SLT, Income, religion, Living area, Family members, Numbers of Members used SLT, Mobile use was completed. Information about SLT use, influence on the start of SLT habit and related risk elements were collected.</p>

                <p>The collected information was checked for errors, coded and pass in into a database using SPSS software. Analysis targeted the research objectives by considering the indicators. Descriptive analysis of all relevant variables was done using measures of central tendency, Association and differentials within/between variables was tested using appropriate test. Statistical tests used to regulate the relationship between exposure and outcome variables included χ2 test, Fisher’s exact test, independent sample t-test and ANOVA. To test the statistical significance, the p value level of &lt;0.05 was considered. Logistic regression was applied to find out the factors influencing health effects due to SLT uses among low income peoples. Special effects of exposure variables were similarly measured once correcting for added variables by multivariate analyses. In addition to Odds Ratio (OR), 5% level of significance of different estimates was also estimated.</p>

                <title>Operational Definitions</title>
                <p>Low socioeconomic populations: The household income, expenditure survey 2010 of BBS suggested that TK. 1250 per person per month is categorized as the poor living in low socioeconomic areas at the nationwide that translates to an average income of TK. 5500 per family per month.</p>
                <p>Low Income people in the industrial belt: As per the definition of BBS, per capita earning of Taka 1250 or less is considered as low income group people [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It would be far higher in line for to inflation and other factors over time. However, in the industrial areas in the periphery of the capital, scope of earning of such group of people is much greater than other areas of the country. It was observed that the income of respondents is about 46 percent higher than that of the reference cutoff point.</p>
                <p>Industrial Area: The areas where usually employees of industries along with their relatives reside. In the proposed study, Tongi and Demra are considered as Industrial areas. There are Pharmaceuticals, Garments, Steel and Re-rolling and many other Industries. Essential commodities of SLT were produced in these areas.</p>
                <p>Demarcation of the study zone: Firsthand information was gathered by visiting the spots of the research zone. Two adjacent zones of Dhaka Metropolitan city, viz. Tongi and Demra, were selected for the research as these are industrial areas, easily approachable and traditionally they practice SLT higher than others.</p>

The mean age of beginning of SLT habit was found to be 26.43±8.57 years in males and 25.83±9.75 years in females respectively. In this research the respondents mostly use <italic>zarda</italic> than other SLT. Around 98 percent of males use <italic>zarda</italic>, while it is 92 percent among women as observed. Use of <italic>sadapata</italic> and <italic>Gul</italic> was found higher among females (10.4 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively) in comparison to males (3.2 percent and 5.3%, respectively). The types of SLT habit (p&lt;0.001), number of SLT practices per day (p&lt;0.005) and currently using cigarettes, <italic>the bidi</italic> along with SLT (p&lt;0.001) were positively correlated among man and woman users. In independent sample t-test, number of SLT intake per day was found significantly higher (p&lt;0.013) in Male (10.05±08.0 per day) than Female (8.34±6.67per day). On the other hand, the mean time period of SLT practice was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in female (18.13±11.91 years) than that of males (16.10±10.28 years).</p>

                <p>Respondents from Demra (p&lt;0.001) and Males (p&lt;0.013) used SLT significantly more than their colleagues. The frequency of SLT practice augmented with age and peaking in the 66 and above year age group. SLT practice was found significantly more among the respondents who have secondary education than others (p&lt;0.047). Businessmen used it significantly more often than others (the housewife, servicemen and garments workers or day laborer) (p&lt;0.029). Multiple regression models showed an insignificant effect of age on the frequency of SLT use after controlling for other variables (<xref rid="pone.0156887.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Since tobacco use has been conveyed to be greater among the poor and less educated people, both disease burden along with an economic burden due to tobacco use will disproportionately affect them [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SLT use is a habit with adverse consequences ranging from benign oral lesions to cancer. The practice of the SLT increase in all countries from highly industrialized ones like Sweden and Canada to developing ones like Nepal and Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>The mean age of instigation of SLT practice was found to be 26.4±8.6 years in males and 25.8±9.8 years in females respectively. The frequency of SLT practice increased with age highest in the 66 and above year age group. Another study in Bangladesh mentioned that the mean age at the onset of SLT practice was 31.5 years [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This was more than our study findings, our sample came from low-income industrial areas. It is expected that low-income people started using SLT earlier as it is socially acceptable, less expensive entertainment [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It reveals that the frequency of SLT practice increases with age is dependable with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This increased likelihood of SLT practice is correlated to the social acceptance of SLT consumption by older people and a greater appeal of cigarette among the younger generations who may be taking up smoking instead of SLT consumption. The average time of SLT practice was significantly higher in female (18.13±11.91 years) than that of males (16.10±10.28 years). Prior start would be required to build the infection load by expanding clients' duration of lifetime exposure to carcinogens [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study the most frequent form of SLT intake was zarda than other SLT. Around 98 percent of males use zarda, while it is 92 percent amongst females as observed. These findings are higher than other Bangladeshi studies [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Use of sadapata and gul was higher among females (10.4 percent and 10 percent, respectively) in comparison to that of males (3.2 percent and 5.3 percent respectively). But no significant gender differentials were witnessed in the occurrence of gul use in other studies in Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is revealed from the data that gul use is (10 percent among female and 5.3% among male) greater than the preceding Bangladeshi study [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A USA study found that gender is highly related to SLT users (4 percent), where males found the largest group of SLT users with the frequency rate of 8 percent, while among females it was near to 1 percent [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study revealed that the brands of SLT practice (p&lt;0.001), number of SLT intake per day (p&lt;0.005), mean length of SLT practice (p&lt;0.05) and currently using a cigarette, bidi along with SLT (p&lt;0.001) were positively correlated among man and woman users. Several factors influence SLT use, including ethnicity, demographic and psychosocial factors, its accessibility and public policy. Personal habits are dictated by different communal and traditional behaviors in both sexes [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>SLT habit was found meaningfully more recurrent among the respondents who were educated up to secondary level than others (p&lt;0.047). The expanded likelihood of SLT use among the ignorant and less taught Bangladeshis might show that comparable variable are included in the start of SLT utilize and smoked tobacco among Bangladeshis [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Comparable financial contrasts in SLT use were additionally reported in India [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156887.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Education always plays a vigorous role in the health status of a country and also in the progress of healthy behavior of a person. Our study also showed that business persons, housewives, servicemen and garment workers used SLT frequently. These occupational groups are maximum at hazard for the exposure of SLT usage than other occupations.</p>
              <p>According to WHO, SLT practice is the main cause of mouth cancer. Due to the high use rate of SLT habit, South East Asia carries the highest burden of mouth cancer as over 95,000 cases each year suffer from it; 50% are caused by tobacco [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Oral cancer affects the poor class [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], who has a greater coverage to SLT and is consistent with the current study findings. SLT usage is the crucial risk element for non-communicable and communicable diseases. Logistic regression analysis suggests that male were more likely to suffer from SLT related diseases than females (OR 1.288; 95% CI: 0.646 to 2.567). Suffering from any disease increased significantly with the less frequently SLT use to more frequently SLT use (p&lt;0.015; OR 3.301; CI: 1.263 to 8.628). A study in Dhaka concluded that tobacco consumption-either through mastication or smoldering–was a vital aspect in the growth of mouth cancer [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Studies conducted in Asia exhibited that the mortality danger for females who ingest SLT is larger than that for men [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The issues associated with the SLT habit in this paper found in a survey in India [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The practice of SLT practice is almost alike in the low educated population groups in India also in Sri Lanka [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Low level of education constitutes as a significant indicator of the consumption of SLT, another factor is wealthy family for both man and woman [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is because the low education status of the people is less alert of the health risks of the practice of SLT and have a bigger chance to have a fatality and risk [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The practice of SLT start is simple as it is worthy and affected by the general public, family and companions. The SLT consumption was witnessed to be a typical practice in Bangladesh. Experienced grownups (26+years) of low socioeconomic status, living zone, occupation and educational status will probably be connected with the use of SLT. Anyone, irrespective of age can easily buy every single SLT item. The absence of information on the leaving strategy, structure identified by smokeless type of tobacco and is almost a neglected policy area. In Bangladesh there is no public policy related to SLT. The outcomes of this study could be considered for defining future SLT control approaches in Bangladesh. The products of the SLT are cheap and simply reachable to the users in Bangladesh. We found that those who practice SLT are unequivocally connected to the users of low financial status and less education. An extensive embargo on SLT use should be executed by the policy makers established in the standard guideline in 'Article 13' in the Charter Agreement of WHO [<xref rid="pone.0156887.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition a requirement for an across the nation campaign instructing individuals about the wellbeing danger of SLT consumer.</p>
