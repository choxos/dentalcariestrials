                  <p>Aragonite from animal origin such as cuttlefish bone powder is an abrasive with hardness properties ideal for calculus removal. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test the efficacy of a cuttlebone‐derived aragonite toothpaste in removing dental calculus.</p>

                  <title>Materials and Methods</title>
                  <p>Eighty‐one patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were blindly and randomly assigned into two study groups. The intervention treatment group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 40) received cuttlebone toothpaste (Dr. D‐Tart) and the control group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 41) received an off‐the‐shelf commercial toothpaste (Crest). Evaluations were performed before and after scaling and polishing procedures done at 3 months in order to evaluate the toothpaste's ability to remove calculus and to prevent calculus formation. Calculus, stains, plaque, and gingival indices scores, and patient satisfaction surveys were compared at baseline (first visit), 3, and 9 months, using generalized linear models and Wald's <italic toggle="yes">χ</italic>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>At the end of the 3‐month period, the intervention group showed a 30% reduction in total calculus compared to the baseline score (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .0006) and 45% less total calculus compared to the control group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .0001). Six months after scaling, the mean calculus score for Crest users was 42% higher than that for Dr. D‐Tart users (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .0692). There was a significant improvement in the gingival health of cuttlebone toothpaste users at the observed intervals, and both kinds of toothpaste achieved comparable results in terms of plaque and stains removal.</p>

                  <p>Aragonite toothpaste can remove calculus, prevent calculus formation, and improve gingival health. Patients are generally satisfied with the performance of the aragonite toothpaste. Clinical significance: Animal‐derived aragonite toothpaste (Dr. D‐Tart) shows promising efficacy in removing calculus, preventing calculus formation, and for the improvement of gingival health.

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Periodontal disease is amongst the most prevalent oral diseases worldwide and in North America (Canadian Health Measures Survey, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; P. Eke et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; P. I. Eke et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ismail et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Tremblay et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). According to the 2007/2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey, 16% of Canadian adults and 24% of older adults, 60–79 years of age, were found to have moderate periodontal disease (Brown et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Moreover, 11% of Canadian adults were found to have calculus scores in the highest range (Canadian Health Measures Survey, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For the year 1999, estimates showed that the expenditure for periodontal treatments in the United States was about $14.3 billion (Tremblay et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Periodontitis is mainly caused by calculus, the calcified form of dental plaque. Calculus carries several pathogenic microbes that cause periodontitis. If not treated, periodontal inflammation may cause progressive destruction of periodontal tissues (Najeeb et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Dental calculus is a calcified mineralized plaque composed primarily of calcium phosphate salts covered by an unmineralized bacterial biofilm layer (Roberts‐Harry &amp; Clerehugh, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). It is firmly attached to the tooth, filling the pits and irregularities of tooth surfaces (Jowett et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Calculus can form both at the supragingival and subgingival levels. Subgingival calculus is more virulent and can only be removed by professional treatment; however, supragingival calculus is more accessible to cleaning tools and could be controlled by the patient. Supragingival calculus has been related to the presence of the more damaging subgingival calculus and to progressive periodontal disease (Jepsen et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Nogueira Moreira et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Thus, the removal of supragingival calculus can help improve the health of the periodontal tissues by reducing subgingival levels of pathogenic bacteria and reducing pocket depths and gingival inflammation and bleeding (Jepsen et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Nogueira Moreira et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p>
              <p>Dental calculus plays an important etiological role in the initiation and progression of periodontal diseases (Adriaens &amp; Adriaens, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Roberts‐Harry &amp; Clerehugh, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), and the removal of it maintains adequate periodontal health (Lang et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Currently, conventional tooth brushing is unable to remove calculus that is hard and resistant (Schiff et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The most effective means to control dental calculus is to remove it mechanically by dentists and dental hygienists, mainly by scaling and polishing. This labor‐intensive procedure poses a burden to patients in terms of costs and access to dental professionals (Krause et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and it can cause possible cementum and dentin substance loss. In this regard, several kinds of toothpaste have been developed to dissolve and soften the mineralized deposits using abrasive or chemical agents, such as crystallization inhibitors and mucinase. Toothpastes with strong abrasives are associated with a high risk of abrasive damage to tooth structures (Canadian Health Measures Survey, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), while toothpastes with anticalculus chemical agents are effective in reducing calculus deposition, but they do not remove formed calculus (Cvjetinovic et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Jowett et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Krause et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and they affect supragingival calculus but not subgingival calculus (Jepsen et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Ideally, abrasives for calculus removal should be able to remove calculus without affecting dentin. This means that the hardness of the abrasive should be higher than that of calculus, but lower than dentin and cementum. The performance of abrasive particles such as those found on toothpaste also depends on particle size, morphology, charge, and toughness (Lee et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For example, wear rates increase when the surface films are polished and the abrasives are oppositely charged (Sharath &amp; Babu, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>); in addition, for small abrasives, the wear rate increases proportionally with the increase in the abrasive particle size until it reaches the critical particle size (CPS). After reaching the CPS, the wear rate changes (Coronado &amp; Sinatora, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Regarding particle morphology, particles with high attack angles tend to abrade by cutting through the surface, whereas particles that are less sharp would abrade by ploughing the surface (Coronado &amp; Sinatora, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sevima &amp; Eryurekb, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Zum Gahr, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Also, the properties of the surface play a role in its wear resistance. For example, low fracture toughness materials such as dental calculus wear by fragmentation; on the other hand, tougher materials such as dentin wear by ploughing and cutting mechanisms. In this sense, abrasives for calculus removal should be optimized for fragmentation wear rather than ploughing or cutting mechanisms (Gates &amp; Gore, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>).</p>
              <p>The cuttlefish is a marine animal from the family cephalopods that has a unique inner mineralized tissue called the cuttlebone. This sophisticated buoyancy device is made of extensive superposed chambers that have a complex internal arrangement of calcified pillars made of the mineral calcium carbonate in its aragonite (orthorhombic) form and organic membranes made of a chitin–protein complex (Checa et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Chitin is a modified polysaccharide with well‐known antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory activity that suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines and favors fibroblast migration (Benhabilesa et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lim et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The hierarchically organized aragonite is made of self‐organized diverse biomineral structures characterized by complex morphologies of hierarchically organized aragonite nanocrystals. With sharp angle forms that are ideal for abrasive particles design to achieve fragmentation and cutting wear (Čadež et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For the reasons mentioned above, cuttlebone powder has been suggested as a potential useful abrasive for toothpastes for calculus removal; however, this has been never scientifically proven, and no clinical study has assessed this possibility.</p>
              <p>Therefore, recently a new aragonite toothpaste made from cuttlebone has been developed specifically for calculus removal (Dr. D‐Tart toothpaste; Visionaturolab Inc., Terrebonne, QC, Canada). Our preliminary in vitro results showed that this toothpaste can selectively remove substantial amounts of calculus from tooth surfaces without damaging dentin (Kamath &amp; Umesh Nayak, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Building on this preclinical preliminary work, we have designed a randomized double‐blinded controlled clinical trial to assess the effect of cuttlebone toothpaste on dental calculus removal.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Dr. D‐Tart toothpaste in removing dental calculus compared to an off‐the‐shelf antitartar toothpaste (Crest® Complete Whitening Plus Scope, tartar control; Procter &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA) (DIEYE &amp; NDIME, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>The working hypothesis was that there is a statistically significant difference between Dr. D‐Tart and control toothpaste in terms of dental calculus removal capacity. In addition, secondary outcomes such as dental stains and patient satisfaction were also assessed.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The study was conducted as a double‐blinded randomized controlled parallel‐group trial. This study was approved by the human subjects' ethics board at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (application A08‐M35‐16B) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 2013. The intervention group received Dr. D‐Tart toothpaste to remove calculus and stains on their teeth, while the control group received an off‐the‐shelf toothpaste (Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope, tartar control; Procter &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Besides aragonite, Dr. D‐Tart toothpaste ingredients also include water, humectants, sorbitol, thickening silica, surfactants, and stabilizers. The active ingredients in the Crest toothpaste include sorbitol, disodium pyrophosphate, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Crest toothpaste was chosen because its abrasiveness, sorbitol content, and pH are comparable to Dr. D‐Tart toothpaste, and therefore these characteristics were controlled in order to prevent unwanted interactions (Comité dentifrice of Collège François‐Xavier‐Garneau, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Dieye &amp; Ndime, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The recruitment and data collection was done by a hygienist certified by the Quebec Federation of Dental Hygienists and the College of Dental Hygienists of Quebec. The recruitment started in April 2017 and lasted until March 2018. After a baseline assessment upon recruitment, each participant received appointments after 3, 6, and 9 months in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the toothpastes in removing calculus and preventing its formation.</p>

                <title>Exclusion criteria</title>
                <p>Subjects were excluded from participating in the study if they met these exclusion criteria: (1) any physical handicap, psychological, or health conditions that might jeopardize the ability of the patients to brush their teeth and/or attend the appointments; (2) use of antibiotics or anti‐inflammatory drugs within 1 month before the study, to avoid bias when assessing the gingival health; (3) regular use of chlorhexidine oral products, since these products can affect biofilm and calculus formation and introduce bias in our assessment of calculus removal by our toothpaste; (4) sensitivity to tartar‐control toothpastes; (5) presence of oral prostheses, dental implants, or fixed orthodontic appliances on teeth that will be included in the assessment since these devices can introduce bias to the study because they tend to increase the rate of plaque accumulation; (6) patients currently receiving dental treatment that would result in the removal of plaque or calculus and compromise our ability to measure calculus removed by the toothpastes; (7) patients unable to return for evaluations/study recalls, to avoid the significant loss of participants; (8) advanced periodontitis in the form of by having a Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR) scale of 4; these patients have a high risk of tooth loss that could compromise calculus measurements during the study; (9) pregnancy, since it could prevent patients from complying with long evaluation sessions due to delivery and postpartum responsibilities; in addition, the gingival inflammation that usually occurs during pregnancy could introduce bias to the study.</p>
                <p>Patients were recruited through advertisements on the radio, newspapers, social media, the Quebec Federation of Dental Hygienists, College of Dental Hygienists of Quebec, and the advertising board at Cégep Garneau and Université Laval. A website was made available for the public, in which potential participants were able to find the protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and forms to complete for people who were interested to join. Participants interested in joining the study were asked to fill out the dental and medical history forms. Suitable participants who fulfilled the study criteria were contacted and given an opportunity to ask questions, discuss the study protocol with the dental hygienist and to take the Research Consent Form home for further consideration, and they were enrolled in the study after providing informed consent.</p>
                <p>Randomization of participants was carried out off‐site by a statistician at the Faculty of Dentistry at McGill University. After screening and clinical examination, all participants enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to either the intervention (D‐Tart toothpaste) or control (Crest toothpaste) groups following a computer‐generated randomization list. The D‐Tart and control toothpastes were provided in an identical packaging, except for a coded identification number. The receptionist in the clinic was responsible for the coding process and giving the coded toothpastes to the participants. The coding for the toothpastes was withheld from the examiners until data analysis was completed.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome of the study was the amount of calculus removed by the toothpastes. The secondary outcomes were the amount of extrinsic tooth stains removed from the upper and lower incisors and reduction in gingival inflammation, and patient satisfaction with the performance of the toothpastes. All clinical parameters were evaluated by one calibrated examiner at baseline (first visit), 3, and 9 months.</p>
                <p>At baseline sessions, the following clinical parameters were recorded as reported in the literature (Volpe et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>):

</p>
                <p>After the initial evaluation, each participant was provided with the toothpaste and standard advice on tooth brushing (modified Stillman brushing technique), as well as a standardized oral hygiene kit that included an ultrasoft toothbrush (Gum 475 Microtip Copm Ultrasoft Comp Toothbrush, Sunstar Americas, Inc., Schaumburg, IL), end‐tuft toothbrush (Gum 308 End Tuft Tooth Brush, Sunstar Americas, Inc., Schaumburg, IL), a box of small interproximal brushes (Gum Proxabrush Go‐Betweens 414, Sunstar Americas, Inc., Schaumburg, IL), a box of large interproximal brushes (Gum Proxabrush Go‐Betweens 614, Sunstar Americas, Inc., Schaumburg, IL), and dental floss (Gum ButlerWeave waxed, Sunstar Americas, Inc., Schaumburg, IL). Each participant was trained to use the modified Stillman brushing technique and the following instructions were given:

</p>
                <p>Comparisons to baseline measurements and monitoring of the effect of the toothpastes before scaling during the first 3 months of the trial allowed assessment of their ability to remove dental calculus and manage gingivitis and stains and plaque, as most of the patients during this period had substantial calculus build‐ups. At 3 months, the participants were re‐examined, and the same data was recorded in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the toothpastes in removing the plaque, calculus, and stains, and maintaining gingival health.</p>
                <p>At the same appointment, the participants were provided with a standard dental cleaning; thorough scale using ultrasonic and hand instruments followed by polishing with prophylaxis paste (fine bubble gum; Sunstar Butler, Guelph, ON, Canada) and topical application of neutral fluoride. Then, they were asked to continue using the same toothpaste and brushing technique/instructions that were described above. All the examinations were repeated for the participants at 6 and 9 months in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the toothpastes in preventing calculus formation. At the end of the trial (9‐month visit), the participants were offered a scale and polish free of charge as an incentive.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to assess the performance of a toothpaste using cuttlebone powder as an abrasive. Our results indicated that the toothpaste cuttlebone aragonite (Dr. D‐Tart) was effective in calculus removal, prevention of calculus formation, and for the improvement of gingival health. The patient satisfaction survey data indicated that patients treated with the aragonite toothpaste were statistically significantly more satisfied and that they suffered no major side effects. We discuss these results in detail below.</p>

                <title>Calculus removal</title>
                <p>During the first 3 months of our study, no scaling was performed. Therefore, calculus reduction during this period was indicative of the calculus removal capabilities of the toothpastes tested. In our control group, there was a slight increase in the amount of calculus, which indicates that Crest toothpaste did not remove calculus. This is consistent with the literature on toothpaste for calculus control, reporting that anti‐alculus toothpastes do not remove calculus that has already formed, but rather help prevent the formation of additional calculus (Dupont &amp; Plummer, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; White, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). On the other hand, patients who used the aragonite toothpaste were characterized by a lower level of calculus accumulation. This result indicates that cuttlebone‐derived aragonite toothpaste removes calculus. This is probably related to the unique hardness and specific surface area of the cuttlefish bone powder abrasives (North et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Other anticalculus toothpastes relied on chemical agents for crystal growth inhibition and hard silica abrasives for stain removal. This has limitations because crystal‐growth inhibitors can prevent calculus buildup, but they do not contribute to calculus removal, while silica abrasives are harder than the tooth enamel and dentin, which limits the amount that could be used in toothpaste to achieve cleaning efficiency without causing tooth damage (Fairbrother &amp; Heasman, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Franzo et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Joiner et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). On the other hand, cuttlebone powder is an abrasive that is softer than tooth enamel and dentin and it is characterized by a relatively high surface area.</p>

                <title>Prevention of calculus formation</title>
                <p>After the first scaling, the patients treated with the aragonite toothpaste exhibited low levels of calculus over a prolonged period compared to the patients treated with the Crest toothpaste who showed a progressive increase in calculus buildup. Over the 6‐month period that followed the scaling session, the mean calculus score for Crest users was 42% higher than that for the users of the aragonite toothpaste.</p>
                <p>Prevention of calculus formation is a feature described in several commercialized toothpastes that are achieved by two types of active ingredients: chemical products that prevent crystal growth and mechanical abrasives (Fairbrother &amp; Heasman, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Among the chemical crystal growth inhibitors used in toothpastes for the prevention of calculus formation, zinc citrate trihydrate reduces calculus formation by 30% over 13 weeks, sodium hexametaphosphate inhibits calculus compared to triclosan/copolymer dentifrice after 6 months, and pyrophosphate (3.3%) reduces calculus accumulation by 32.3% after 6 months (Grases et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Segreto et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Also, toothpastes with stannous fluoride (0.454%) and sodium hexametaphosphate (13%) reduce calculus buildup by 56% at 6 months compared to triclosan/copolymer toothpastes (Schiff et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Sodium polyaspartate and arginine have no significant advantage regarding calculus deposition (Jowett et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>
                <p>Regarding calculus control using abrasive agents, toothpastes with high cleaning grade silica particles achieve a statistically significant 34% reduction in mean Volpe–Manhold Calculus Index score as compared to a negative control dentifrice after 8 weeks (Sowinski et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p>
                <p>In this context, the ability of the aragonite toothpaste assessed in this study is on the upper end of the reported literature on toothpaste design for the prevention of calculus buildup.</p>

                <title>Gingival inflammation</title>
                <p>Although some toothpastes, such as those containing triclosan, have been shown to be effective in improving gingivitis and periodontal health (Davies et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). So far, neither a therapeutic benefit (in terms of less gingivitis or less caries) nor a societal benefit (in terms of less treatment demand) has been demonstrated as a result of the anticalculus and whitening effects of toothpastes (Van Loveren &amp; Duckworth, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Thus, one unexpected finding in this study was that there was a significant improvement in the gingival health of aragonite toothpaste users compared to the Crest group. This is very relevant because gingival inflammation is a well‐known precursor for periodontal disease and reducing gingivitis could help reduce the risk of developing periodontal disease.</p>
                <p>It could be assumed that the effect of cuttlebone aragonite toothpaste on gingival inflammation could be related to the reduction observed in calculus buildup. The presence of calculus is associated with gingival inflammation, and it is considered a secondary etiological factor for gingival inflammation. Indeed, toothpastes with no effect on calculus tend to have limited or no effect on gingivitis (Grases et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Another potential reason behind the anti‐inflammatory effect of cuttelbone toothpaste could be its high content in sorbitol (10%), which has an anti‐inflammatory effect on gingival tissues (Saheer et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Soeteman et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), although the crest toothpaste also had sorbitol as the active ingredient.</p>

                <title>Stain removal</title>
                <p>Regarding stain removal, both toothpastes were comparable in preventing tooth staining, as there were no significant differences between the dental stain indices of both groups.</p>
                <p>Toothpastes able to remove extrinsic stains, such as the Crest toothpaste used in our study, are often referred to as whitening toothpastes (Hara &amp; Turssi, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These toothpastes usually contain chemical agents or abrasives that increase their ability to remove extrinsic stains and/or prevent their formation. Some examples of such chemicals include, for example, peroxide, enzymes, citrate, triclosan, baking soda, pyrophosphate and hexametaphosphate, and calcium carbonate (Hara &amp; Turssi, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Saheer et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Soeteman et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Van Loveren &amp; Duckworth, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this context, it could be speculated that the aragonite present in the experimental toothpaste we tested had a whitening effect defined by its ability to remove stains, and this whitening effect was expected because the antistain whitening effects of toothpastes are to some extent based on the same compounds that achieve anticalculus effects (Van Loveren &amp; Duckworth, <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>

                <title>Patient satisfaction</title>
                <p>One major concern with toothpastes designed for calculus removal is that their abrasiveness could cause side effects such as sensitivity or ulcers. Adverse reactions to toothpastes are rare but should be considered in unexplained skin or respiratory allergies and gingival or lip lesions (Davies et al., <xref rid="cre2559-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the patients treated with the aragonite toothpaste reported fewer incidents of sensitivity or ulcers than the patients using the control toothpaste, which seems to indicate that aragonite toothpaste does not cause any clinically relevant side effects.</p>

                <title>Strengths, limitations, and future directions</title>
                <p>The main strength of this study is the randomization of the patients, which is confirmed by the similar baseline characteristics in both study groups. Another very important strength is the blinding at multiple levels; the patients were blinded to the type of treatment they received, the hygienist performing the measurements and the scaling were also blinded to group allocation. Another strength is the prolonged follow‐up that allowed us to assess the effect of the toothpastes long after a scaling intervention. Moreover, the standardization of the hygiene instructions for all patients was also a strength. All patients used the same oral hygiene kit, following the same oral hygiene instructions.</p>
                <p>However, this study has some limitations that motivate future research. One of such limitations was the variability in calculus buildup across patients; anecdotally, it was observed that some patients exhibited very large and fast calculus buildups, while others exhibited less. This could be explained by specific conditions in each patient. One example is the reduced salivary flow observed in some patients that could have increased the speed of calculus build‐up. In addition, dietary or genetic factors were not considered in this study and that can be studied in the future. Another limitation is not standardizing patient's periodontal disease, including patients with health problems since their medications could also affect calculus formation. Nonetheless, to address these limitations, the individual patient was included as a random factor in the generalized linear mixed models.</p>
                <p>In addition, even though the aragonite dentifrice was effective in managing dental calculus, the potential health benefits of the prevention of dental caries are doubtful since it does not contain fluoride. Future research and development would be needed to add fluoride to the cuttlebone‐derived aragonite toothpaste to address this issue.</p>
                <p>In this study the aragonite toothpaste was compared only to single commercial toothpaste (Crest complete). The control toothpaste was selected because it has been specifically designed for tartar control. However, future studies would be needed to compare aragonite toothpastes with other types of toothpastes, including those that are not designed for tartar control in order to further test its effectiveness in calculus removal.</p>
                <p>We believe these findings are internally valid as the study design minimized bias by double‐blinding and random distribution of confounders to treatment and control groups. However, external validity should be interpreted with caution due to the several and strict inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study.</p>
