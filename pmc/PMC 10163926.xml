                  <p id="Par1">Loss of taste (ageusia) is a symptom observed following recovery from COVID-19 infection. The loss of taste and smell sensation may negatively affect patientsâ quality of life (QoL). The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Diode Laser in managing loss of taste sensation in patients with post-COVID syndrome versus the placebo.</p>

                  <title>Material and method</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The study sample was 36 patients who complained of persistent loss of taste sensation following COVID-19. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups according to the received treatment: Group I (laser treatment) and Group II (light treatment), with each patient receiving a diode laser treatment or placebo from the same operator. Taste sensation was subjectively measured after treatment for four weeks.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The results demonstrated a significant difference between both groups regarding taste restoration after one month (pâ=â0.041), with Group II having a significantly higher percentage of cases 7 (38.9%) with partial taste restoration. In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of Group I 17 cases (94.4%) had complete taste restoration (pâ&lt;â0.001).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par7">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) infection lead to a global pandemic with a significant impact on health, social aspects, and wealth. Since the breakout of the virus in china, 80% of infected patients have developed mild to moderate symptoms, while 5% have developed severe symptoms. The virus mortality rate ranged between 3 and 12% of infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Various studies reported a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, and, in some cases, shortness of breath, dysosmia, and dysgeusia. In addition to these symptoms, many authors reported different oral manifestations in patients with SARS- Cov2 infection. These manifestations could range from self-limiting disorders like unspecific oral ulceration, desquamative gingivitis, petechiae, and co-infection like candidiasis to more complicated manifestations like mucormycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Loss of taste sensation was one of the early or subclinical symptoms of SARS-CoV2. The prevalence ranged from 47 to 67% in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection, and 20% of all patients reported it as an isolated or as the first symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Those signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV2 infection lasted 7â10 days in mild to moderate cases; recovery can take up to six months in severe cases. Many studies report that a large percentage of patients who recovered from SARS-CoV 2 infection may have one or more symptoms that last for weeks or even months. These long-lasting symptoms were referred to as post-COVID syndrome or long COVID-19. The prevalence of long COVID ranged between 10 ââ47% and could persist for 8â12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Loss of taste sensation is one of the symptoms that had a high prevalence among patients with long COVID. Moraschini et al.

Different studies reported the impact of QoL, including decreased pleasure in food, poor appetite, trouble with cooking and detecting spoiled food, alteration in body weight, feelings of vulnerability, mood changes, depression, and deterioration in social interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Different medications have been used to treat post-COVID loss of taste, including oral corticosteroids, zinc sulfate, topical corticosteroids, theophylline, caroverine, vitamin A, sodium citrate, and minocycline. However, scientific evidence on the effectiveness of these drugs was limited, and no randomized controlled trials exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">The current study has revealed that the pathogenicity of SARS-Cov2 was initiated by the virusâs targeting of ACE-2 receptors, which allow viral entry into cells. ACE-2 receptors are found throughout the oral mucosa, particularly on the tongue and in the salivary glands. With viral-induced hyperinflammation, the downregulation of ACE-2 receptors may result in endothelial dysfunction, as well as dysfunction at viral entry points and in multiple organs. This chain of events may reveal a possible mechanism for loss of taste by demonstrating the unique mechanisms and interactions between thrombosis and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">This study proposes the diode laser 940 as a possible treatment for the loss of taste sensation in patients with long COVID. The low-level laser using diode lasers of wavelengths 588â940Â nm had bio-stimulatory impacts on target tissues. In addition, it regulates biochemical processes by improving the anti-oxidant system that can boost mitochondria breathing, reduce tissue damage and produce ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Diode Laser 940Â nm in managing loss of taste sensation in patients with post-COVID syndrome versus the placebo.</p>

The randomization ensures that an equal number of participants are assigned to each group using a random block design with blocks of sizes 2, 4, and 6 within each group. Patients were not aware of the type of treatment they were receiving. After recovery from COVID-19, 36 patients in the study complained of persistent loss of taste sensation. The selection of patients was determined by inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria include Adults (&gt;â18 years old) with a positive test for SARS CoV- 2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After recovering from the COVID-19 infection, patients continued to experience a persistent loss of 4 basic taste sensations for at least four weeks after COVID-19 recovery. Patients with pre-existing olfactory or gustatory dysfunction without a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection diagnosis, pregnant women, patients with any systemic disease, patients who received any treatment to accelerate gustatory function recovery, or taking any medications that cause loss of taste or smell were excluded from the study.</p>

It has been used to enhance wound healing, gingival depigmentation, acceleration of tissue regeneration, treatment of temporomandibular disorders, alleviation of chronic orofacial pain, and induction of bone regeneration. Numerous studies have demonstrated that 940 to 980Â nm diode laser wavelengths effectively reduce postoperative inflammation, enhance wound healing, and accelerate tissue regeneration.This study presents the diode laser 940 as a potential treatment for the loss of taste sensation in COVID patients. The diode laser 940 had an energy density of 4Â J/cm2, which is considered the minimal energy density necessary for postoperative pain relief, anti-inflammatory effect, and edema elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

The proposed treatment strategy brought a positive consequence to the resolution of loss of taste sensation as their results showed that patients treated with diode laser 940 have a significantly higher percentage of cases 13 (72.2%) restoring taste after one week. Moreover, patients treated with diode laser 940 have a significantly higher percentage of cases 17(94.4%) having complete restoration of taste.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The patients in the present study had persistent symptoms for a mean of 1.17âÂ±â0.53 months in Group I and 0.93âÂ±â0.28 months in Group II. This could be considered a relatively short period for long COVID, lasting from 8 to 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Moraschini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] concluded that 18.8% and 14.1% of patients who recovered from COVID-19 still have persistent symptoms, long-term as anosmia and ageusia, respectively, after a follow-up period of 67 days. This short period of long COVID may be contributed to the impact on QoL. Brasseler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] investigate the incidence of subsequent eating disorders in these patients and SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who did not experience anosmia and ageusia during the same period and concluded that 6 out of 24 patients demonstrated increased fixation on their eating behavior post-COVID and over time these patients developed anorexia nervosa.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The present study showed the resolution of loss of taste sensation as their results showed that patients treated with diode laser 940 have a significantly higher percentage of cases 13(72.2%) restoring taste after one week. Rochmawati and Kamilah [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] proposed that the persistence of symptoms in COVID-19 patients was attributed to the overexpression of mitochondrial proteins and the presence of inflammatory markers. In addition, they found increased pro-inflammatory cytokines that could contribute to cytokine dysregulation and a cytokine storm.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The use of low level laser improved cellular metabolism by stimulating photoreceptors in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, releasing growth factors, and changing cellular ATP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Fahimipour et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] suggested that LLLT inhibits severe inflammatory reactions and promotes collagen formation. Qadri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] demonstrated that low-level lasers reduce periodontal and gingival inflammation regardless of wavelength. Moreover, the low-level laser with wavelengths ranging up to 970Â nm improved the activity and number of T lymphocytes that produce cytokines responsible for tissue regeneration. Therefore, improved lymphocyte activity stimulates the phagocytic activity of macrophages, which is essential for the healing process. The low-level laser accelerates tissue regeneration and activation of neoangiogenesis, increasing tissue oxygen pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The present study used single-session low-level therapy in accordance with Momeni et al., who assessed the effect of extraoral 940Â nm low-level diode laser on pain, edema, and trismus following surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. They concluded that Single-session irradiation of a 940Â nm diode laser could effectively decrease pain following third molar extraction surgery. They claimed that multiple laser therapy sessions are time-consuming for both patients and clinicians and often decrease patient compliance.</p>
              <p id="Par37">The present study had several limitations. The present study had a mean young age of participants that limited the study results to the young age group, as age had a significant role in recovery from chemosensory deficits. Moreover, the small sample size did not give enough power to show differences in other demographic data, such as smoking and patientsâ comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">Despite the mentioned limitations, analyzing patientsâ chemosensory disorders through objective tests is a more effective technique for follow-up patients with chemosensory disturbances and avoiding possible under-or over-reporting biases.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par39">The findings of this study indicate that low-level laser therapy is effective in restoring taste sensation in patients with post-COVID-19 dysfunction. Further studies with improved design could address the study limitation and evaluate the current treatment modality in conditions other than SARS-Cov2 patients.</p>
