                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Due to the lack of evidence to determine the best treatment for deep cavitated caries lesions in primary molars, the search for an effective restorative technique, which results in a minimal discomfort to patients, and reduce the time needed for the treatment, becomes relevant. The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate if high-viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC) restorations is noninferior to restoration with calcium hydroxide cement associated with HVGIC for treatment of deep lesions in primary molars, as well as the impact of the treatments on cost and discomfort of the patient.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A non-inferiority randomized clinical trial with two parallels arms (1:1) will be conducted. Children with 4 to 8 years will be selected at Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry at Ibirapuera University. 108 teeth will be randomized into two groups: (1) Calcium hydroxide cement associated with HVGIC and (2) HVGIC restoration. Primary outcome will be considered the pulp vitality and to be evaluated after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months by two calibrated examiners. Survival of restorations will also be evaluated in the equal intervals. The duration of dentals treatment and the cost of all materials used will be considered for estimating of cost-efficacy of each treatment. Individual discomfort will be measured after each dental procedure using the Wong-Baker’s Facial Scale. For the primary outcome, Kaplan-Meier survival and the long-rank test will be used to comparison between the groups. Cox regression will be performed to assess the influence of variables on the outcome. For all analyzes, the significance level is set at 5%.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par7">In Pediatric Dentistry, a number of factors have contributed to the marked decline in dental caries rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, this is a disease that still deserves attention, given its involvement in all age groups and, mainly, its negative impact on children’s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">With the better biological understanding of the disease, as well as the importance of the etiological and modifiers factors, new concepts were developed for treating of these lesions, especially those already cavitated, in order to use less invasive restorative techniques and preventive approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These changes in the paradigms allow, therefore, the accomplishment of more conservative cavity preparations, with significant preservation of enamel and dentin, since it is possible only the removal of the irreversibly affected tissues by the caries lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">The treatment of deep caries lesions closes to the pulp considered healthy, on the other hand, results in a challenge for the dentists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], especially for a gap in well-designed studies that determine the best treatment for these lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Considering the requirements of Minimal Intervention dentistry, indirect pulp capping has been described as an effective option for the treatment of these lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Based on the technique of selective dentin caries removal, indirect pulp capping is performed in a single dental session and aims to use a biocompatible material to protect the dentin-pulp complex, such as calcium hydroxide cement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which would have as benefits the reduction of the number of remaining bacteria as well as a possible dentinal response leading to the formation of a reparative dentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent studies still have suggested the use of inert materials for this protection because they would also have the capacity to arrest the caries process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or, even, the direct restoration of the cavity with adhesive systems associated with resin composite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or resin-modified glass ionomer cement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Nevertheless, the high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC), which has been the material of choice for medium and low deep cavities in Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART), has not been considered in the studies that focusing in treatment of deep caries lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Using this material in pediatric dentistry seems to be an alternative to decrease the time required for the clinical care, due to the facility to perform the restorations with HVGIC. Considering the philosophy of ART, it will be possible to restore the deep caries lesion with pulp vitality without the use of rubber dam and anesthesia. However, to date, there are no well-designed clinical trials evaluating cost-efficacy as well as other important patient-centered outcomes of the treatment of deep caries lesions with HVGIC.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Thus, this study aims as primary outcome to compare the pulp vitality of two types of treatment for deep caries lesions in primary molars (HVGIC restoration and restoration with calcium hydroxide cement associated with HVGIC) by a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial with two parallel arms. The secondary outcomes will compare the survival of restorations, caries progression, cost-efficacy and discomfort between the two treatment options. Our hypothesis is that the dental pulp vitality of teeth restored with HVGIC do not differ from teeth restored with a pulp capping material.</p>

It was considered that a clinically significant difference was 15% in the success rate between the groups. Therefore, considering a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, using a one-tailed test for non-inferiority studies, with a 20% increase due to a possible sample loss and 40% by cluster of more than one tooth per children, we reached the final rounded number of 54 teeth per group, resulting in 108 teeth in total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

Thus, this is the first clinical trial that will evaluate as primary outcome the success rate considering the pulp vitality between restoration with calcium hydroxide cement associated with HVGIC and HVGIC restoration for treatment of deep caries lesions in primary molars in according the philosophy of ART.</p>
              <p id="Par52">The evaluation of this outcome will take into account clinical signs associated with symptoms, since that the most of the previous studies considering the survival of restoration as the primary outcome and not pondering the pulp condition. However, the main reason to use the pulp capping material is to protect the pulp tissue. Thus, it should be considered in the evaluation.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Others secondary outcomes will be considered. The choice of outcome measures was based on the efficacy of the treatment, but also in patient-centered outcomes, thinking in about the practice-based evidence where the preference of patient should be englobed in the treatment choice. Analysis of cost will be also performed in order to project the incremental cost of the treatments with higher failure rate for the public health manager.</p>
              <p id="Par54">This is important to highlighted that it will not be possible the blinding of the operators because of the evident differences between the both techniques. Nevertheless, to minimize this situation, the allocation of the treatments will be only performer after the selective caries removal. Furthermore, the patient and examiner can be considered as blinded.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Thus, our study desires to answer if it is possible to restore deep caries lesion of primary teeth only with HVGIC considering the ART philosophy. Since that this hypothesis was sustained, the pediatric dentistry can be used a friendlier technique to deep caries lesion management.</p>
