                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS:</title>
                  <p> Sixteen Caucasian individuals of both sexes, aged between 12 and 16 years old and
in permanent dentition were selected. Eight individuals were treated with
conventional brackets installed on the lower dental arch and self-ligating
brackets on the upper arch. Another eight individuals received self-ligating
brackets in the lower arch and conventional brackets in the upper arch. The
subjects received material and instructions for oral hygiene. Visible plaque index
(VPI), gingival bleeding index (GBI) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were
evaluated just after installation of orthodontic appliances, and 30, 60 and 180
days later. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare differences between groups
(self-ligating and conventional), two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test was used
to assess CAL at each site of each tooth. Significance level was set at 5%. </p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION:</title>
                  <p> No significant changes were found with regard to the periodontal response to
orthodontic treatment for the variables assessed and between subjects receiving
passive self-ligating and conventional brackets. All individuals had received oral
hygiene instructions and had their periodontal conditions monitored.</p>

                  <p> dezesseis indivíduos, leucodermas, em dentição permanente, de ambos os sexos, com
idades de 12 a 16 anos, foram selecionados. Oito foram tratados com braquetes
convencionais instalados na arcada inferior, e braquetes autoligáveis na arcada
superior. Os outros oito indivíduos receberam braquetes autoligáveis na arcada
inferior e braquetes convencionais na arcada superior. Os pacientes receberam
materiais e instruções sobre higiene bucal. O índice de placa visível (IPV), o
índice de sangramento gengival (ISG) e o nível de inserção clínica (NIC) foram
avaliados logo após a instalação do aparelho e 30, 60 e 180 dias mais tarde. Para
comparar as diferenças entre os grupos (braquetes autoligáveis e convencionais),
foi utilizado o teste Mann-Whitney; para analisar o NIC em cada local de cada
dente, foi utilizada a análise de variância de duas vias, seguida do teste de
Tukey, com nível de significância a 5%. </p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>After tooth eruption, bracket bonding is considered the second moment of change in the
intraoral environment. It can cause qualitative and quantitative changes in the oral
microbiota, leading to an increase in the amount of microorganisms not only in saliva,
but also in dental plaque.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Dental plaque is the
primary etiological factor in the development of gingivitis,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> in addition to being the most important factor in the initiation,
progression and recurrence of periodontal disease.<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Orthodontic brackets might hinder proper oral hygiene, which contributes to
the development of an inflammatory process.</p>
              <p>Clinically, plaque formation is particularly favored on the cervical surface of
brackets, below the leveling arch, and its accumulation is exacerbated by patient's
difficulty cleaning these sites. In addition to improper hygiene, gingivitis and
gingival hyperplasia are frequently considered the main consequences produced by
orthodontic treatment on the periodontium.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> When
damage caused to the periodontium is considerable, the benefits of orthodontic treatment
can be questionable.</p>
              <p>Faced with this problem and considering orthodontic brackets as part of its etiology, it
would be interesting to discover which parts of orthodontic appliances have the
possibility to cause less plaque formation. The advantages of self-ligating brackets
include the possibility of performing better hygiene, as they do not require wire
ligatures, recognized as the focus of plaque formation. Elastomers are among the
ligatures that accumulate a great amount of bacteria,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> even elastic ligatures that release fluoride are far from proving effective
and reliable in terms of attachment.<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Comparing metallic and elastic ligatures, bacteriological findings slightly favor
metallic ligatures. Elastic ligatures accumulate 38% more micro-organisms in the form of
plaque when compared to metallic ligatures, thereby contraindicating the use of elastic
ligatures in individuals with bad hygiene habits.<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In terms of bleeding, results were substantially higher with the use of
elastic ligatures.<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is worth noting that the
more bacterial plaque accumulation, the higher the probability of developing an
inflammatory process caused by accumulation and proliferation of bacterial
microbiota.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
              <p>Self-ligating brackets have been a major focus of attention in Orthodontics in recent
years, which explains the various designs developed by manufacturers of orthodontic
material. All of them have very similar characteristics and can be divided into two
groups: active and passive brackets.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>In a study conducted by Pellegrini et al,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> with
the objective of assessing accumulation of bacterial plaque in self-ligating and
conventional brackets, the authors concluded that active self-ligating brackets are less
likely to accumulate dental plaque when compared to conventional brackets. Nevertheless,
it is speculated that active self-ligating brackets allow better hygiene, as they do not
have locks or clips completely closing the bracket slot and forming a fourth wall
(buccal) similar to molar tubes. Passive brackets, on the other hand, present a buccal
wall and, for this reason, could cause plaque accumulation inside the bracket slot.</p>
              <p>There is no report of significant difference in the number of bacteria found in
self-ligating brackets, compared to conventional ones tied with elastomeric ligatures,
whether in metal<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> or aesthetic brackets.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>Depending on the type of brackets used, different microbial trends were found in a study
conducted by Mummolo et al.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The authors
collected saliva samples from 60 patients, divided into three groups of 20 patients each
(self-ligating, conventional and untreated control group) in order to assess
<italic>Lactobacillus spp</italic> and <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The assortment of
the various species of bacteria change over time during the orthodontic treatment, and
seems to show different trends, depending on the type of orthodontic device.
Consequently a periodical microbial monitoring using in-office bacteria tests, seems
indicated.</p>
              <p>All aforementioned considerations, along with the different results found in the studies
previously cited and the growing trend towards the use of self-ligating brackets, seem
to justify the present study which aims to comparatively evaluate the periodontal
response (visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index and clinical attachment level)
when orthodontic treatment is performed with self-ligating and conventional
brackets.</p>

              <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
              <p>This study was approved by Universidade Sagrado Coração Institutional Review Board (USC
045/11). It comprised 16 Caucasian individuals of both sexes, aged between 12 and 16
years old, selected from a sample of individuals referred to orthodontic treatment in
the Department of Orthodontics of the same university. Sample size was calculated by
means of BioEstat 5.3 software based on mean and standard deviation values found by a
preliminary pilot study. According to this estimation, sample size was determined with a
test power of 90%, <italic>α</italic> = 5%, with difference mean and standard deviation
values of 1 and 0.9, respectively.</p>
              <p>Individuals presenting agenesis or impacted teeth (requiring traction); gingivitis prior
to bracket placement; need for orthopedic maxillary expansion, extraction or
interproximal wear to reduce tooth size discrepancy; history of use of drugs that induce
gingivitis, and patients with skeletal deformities ranging from moderate to severe were
excluded from the study. Individuals who agreed to participate in the research answered
a questionnaire to detect potential changes in general health and use of drugs.</p>
              <p>Another inclusion criterion applied in the study was the presence of complete permanent
dentition. Absence of second molars was not considered an exclusion criterion. All
participants presented with dental malocclusion and normal skeletal relationships. All
selected patients should present, during clinical periodontal examination, a visible
plaque index lower than 10% of surfaces (B, MB, DB, L, ML and DL). During clinical
examination, the gingival tissue should present a pale pink color without edema, thereby
indicating gingival bleeding index equal to zero.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

              <p>The individuals were randomly distributed so that eight individuals were submitted to
orthodontic treatment with conventional brackets on the lower arch and self-ligating
brackets on the upper arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01"><bold>Fig 1A</bold></xref>), and eight individuals were submitted to self-ligating brackets on the lower
arch and conventional brackets on the upper arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01"><bold>Fig 1B</bold></xref>). Since patients simultaneously wore both kinds of brackets, the present study
presented acceptable advantages, as there were no alterations in treatment or treatment
goals as a result of each type of bracket being placed on different dental arches.</p>

              <p>All subjects received a tooth-brushing kit (Oral-B, Procter &amp; Gamble do Brasil). The
kit comprised a soft-bristled toothbrush, dental floss and paste. Individuals were also
provided with instructions for standardization of oral hygiene and physiotherapy.
Toothbrushes and dental floss were changed every two months or whenever necessary. Oral
hygiene instructions were given prior to installation of orthodontic appliances, and
combined two brushing techniques<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Patients were instructed to brush their
teeth and use dental floss three times a day.</p>
              <p>Patients were assessed by interview and specific clinical periodontal examinations, such
as visible plaque index (VPI), gingival bleeding index (GBI) and clinical attachment
level (CAL), conducted at six sites per tooth at three different periods (30, 60 and 180
days) after bracket placement. Assessment comprised first and second premolars, canines
and central and lateral incisors of each hemiarch, thereby totaling 20 teeth. In order
to avoid damage to the participants, all periodontal evaluations and instructions
relating to hygiene procedures were given on the same day of orthodontic appliance
activation by a single properly calibrated examiner.</p>
              <p>Calibration procedures were carried out based on VPI, GBI and CAL of five subjects who
were part of the sample,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> within seven
days.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Clinical evaluation began by observing
patients' gingival conditions, using the gingival bleeding index by Löe and
Silness.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Subsequently, fucsin-based tablets
were used in order to evince accumulated plaque. Ciancio et al's<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> evaluation parameter index was adopted, as it was specifically
developed to assess patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. It considers the buccal
surface of teeth, only, as it is subjected to greater dental plaque accumulation after
orthodontic corrective appliance installation.</p>
              <p>CAL was measured on the buccal, mesiobuccal, distobuccal, lingual, mesiolingual and
distolingual faces, with the aid of a manual calibrated periodontal probe (UNC-15). It
corresponds to the sum of measurements referring to gingival margin position and probing
depth, expressed in millimeters, of each site in each tooth. To calculate this index,
each tooth was individually assessed at six different sites and compared at the three
assessment periods. GBI was evaluated by visual and compression analysis of gingival
soft tissues, according to Löe and Silness.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The
scores of each one of the six surfaces of teeth (B, MB, DB, L, ML and DL) were added and
the total was divided by six so as to obtain GBI of each tooth. The GBI of each
individual was obtained by adding the values ​​of each tooth, with the total divided by
the number of teeth evaluated. To obtain VPI, each tooth was individually scored. This
index might be estimated for all tooth surfaces or for a few selected sites. For each
patient, a mean score of all evaluated teeth was calculated.</p>
              <p>Data collected for VPI and GBI were transformed into means and respective standard
deviations. To analyze statistical non-parametric ordinal variables, Friedman test was
used to detect potential differences among the periods analyzed (30, 60 and 180 days),
within the same group. To compare differences between groups (self-ligating and
conventional brackets), Mann-Whitney test was used. To assess CAL at each site of each
tooth, two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, with significance level set at 5%, were
conducted.</p>

              <p>For the gingival bleeding index (GBI), results were similar to those observed for the

between groups. Indexes observed for self-ligating brackets were: 30 days (0.87 ± 0.99),
60 days (0.73 ± 0.70) and 180 days (0.73 ± 0.59), P = 0.528. As for conventional

<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> highlight that orthodontic brackets increase
accumulation of dental plaque, which was also demonstrated by the present study. The
observation period of the potential effects produced on the periodontium, established by
the present study in 30, 60 and 180 days, was considered satisfactory to observe changes
in buccal microbiota.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Results reveal visible
increase in plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation.<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Clinical investigations demonstrate that
deleterious effects produced by fixed appliances on the periodontium are caused by
insertion loss or by the use of orthodontic bands, which are characterized as ideal
sites for bacterial colonization.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the
present study, bands were not used, which limited the deleterious effects produced on
the periodontium due to the presence of appliances, different types of brackets, bands
and ligatures.</p>
              <p>When metallic and elastic ligatures are compared with regard to the amount and quality
of bacterial plaque, gingival bleeding index and depth of periodontal bags,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> some studies have yielded results that favor the
use of metallic ligatures.<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> For this reason, metallic ligatures were used
in the present study. Elastic ligatures accumulate 38% more micro-organisms in the form
of plaque in comparison to metallic ligatures.<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
Still, even metallic ligatures are a focus of plaque formation, which hinders proper
hygiene, as proven by the results of the present study. Although elastomeric ligatures
present a tendency towards higher dental plaque accumulation in comparison to metallic
ligatures, Pandis et al<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> did not find any
differences in the total number of bacteria accumulated in the saliva of patients using
conventional brackets with elastomeric ligature and self-ligating brackets. Therefore,
elastomeric ligatures do not seem to play a major role in determining salivary and
bacterial changes, but influence local adhesion, only.</p>
              <p>In a study that allows direct confrontation with the results of the present study,
Pellegrini et al<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> assessed plaque retention
during treatment. To this end, the authors installed active self-ligating and
conventional brackets with elastomers in 14 dental arches of seven individuals, and
concluded that individuals with self-ligating brackets had lower levels of plaque
accumulation in comparison to those who received conventional brackets. Between the
first and fifth week after bonding, self-ligating brackets presented values of total
bacteria and oral streptococcus statistically lower when compared to conventional
brackets. These results do not corroborate the present study, which found no differences
in plaque formation between the groups treated with self-ligating and conventional
brackets, even when a longer observation period was considered (180 days).</p>
              <p>Other studies<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> demonstrate changes in bacterial colonization,
especially <italic>S. mutans</italic>, in the period that goes before bracket placement
and after analysis. However, there were no differences between self-ligating and
conventional brackets. Even though the present research did not aim at analyzing
bacterial alterations, the comparison between the aforementioned studies demonstrate
that no alterations regarding plaque accumulation and the development of gingival
inflammation were found between the two types of brackets used.</p>
              <p>Most individuals treated with self-ligating brackets featured a low count of bacteria in
bacterial plaque when compared with patients treated with conventional brackets. This is
a relevant fact because the acid-producing bacteria that surround and settle in
orthodontic appliances are a common problem and cause flaws and discoloration of the
tooth enamel surface.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These results suggest
that the use of self-ligating brackets predisposes a reduction in dental plaque
retention on the tooth surface around these devices. However, against this evidence, no
significant differences were found at the site in terms of white lesion development or
formation, which depends more on oral hygiene conditions and less on the bracket type or
ligature used.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p>
              <p>VPI and GBI, calculus index and probing depth were assessed in two types of brackets
(conventional and self-ligating) in 50 subjects during 18 weeks. The authors found no
differences between the periodontal indexes observed in either one of the groups of
brackets.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These results corroborate the data
found in the present study, in which comparison of VPI and GBI between the two groups
showed no statistically significant differences (P &gt; 0.05).</p>
              <p>In this study, most patients, within 180 days, presented with recessions and/or gingival
