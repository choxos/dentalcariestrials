                <p>In periodontitis patients, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota is not only found at clinically diseased periodontal sites but also at clinically healthy periodontal sites, buccal mucosae, tongue, and saliva. The present study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an oral microbiota transplant (OMT) for the treatment of periodontitis in dogs. Eighteen systemically healthy beagle dogs with naturally occurring periodontitis were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to a test or control group. A 4-y-old, periodontally healthy female beagle dog served as a universal OMT donor. To reduce periodontal inflammation, all dogs received full-mouth mechanical debridement of teeth and mucosae 2 wk before baseline. At baseline, full-mouth mechanical debridement was repeated and followed by adjunctive subgingival and oral irrigation with 0.1% NaOCl. Subsequently, test dogs were inoculated with an OMT from the healthy donor. No daily oral hygiene was performed after OMT transplantation. Adverse events were assessed throughout the observation period. Clinical examinations were performed and whole-mouth oral microbiota samples were collected at week 2, baseline, week 2, and week 12. The composition of oral microbiota samples was analyzed using high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing followed by taxonomic assignment and downstream bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Results demonstrated that the intergroup difference in the primary outcome measure, probing pocket depth at week 12, was statistically insignificant. However, the single adjunctive OMT had an additional effect on the oral microbiota composition compared to the full-mouth mechanical and antimicrobial debridement alone. The OMT resulted in an “ecological shift” toward the composition of the donor microbiota, but this was transient in nature and was not observed at week 12. No local or systemic adverse events were observed throughout the study period. The results indicate that OMT may modulate the microbiota composition in dogs with naturally occurring periodontitis and can be applied safely.</p>

              <p>Humans and microorganisms have evolved together in a symbiotic relationship over thousands of years (<xref rid="bibr9-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Didelot et al. 2016</xref>). Colonizing microorganisms provide the human body with various biological functions ranging from the development of mucosal immune barriers to colonization resistance against pathogens (<xref rid="bibr2-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Avila et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Hornef 2015</xref>). Most resident microorganisms are found within the digestive system and are estimated to approximate the number of nucleated human somatic cells (<xref rid="bibr8-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Dewhirst et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Sender et al. 2016</xref>). While a symbiotic microbiota is beneficial to the host, the delicate balance can be disturbed by an overgrowth of accessory pathogens and pathobionts, resulting in an increased pathogenicity of the local microbial community (<xref rid="bibr12-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Hajishengallis and Lamont 2012</xref>). A dysbiosis can induce inflammation and promote a favorable environment for pathogen growth, which in turn exacerbates the host immune responses and inflammatory sequelae (<xref rid="bibr19-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Levy et al. 2017</xref>). It may cause chronic diseases, such as periodontal diseases and ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="bibr14-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Halfvarson et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>The pathogenic potential of various microorganisms and their role in the etiology of periodontitis has been studied extensively (<xref rid="bibr15-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Haubek et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Hajishengallis et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Pérez-Chaparro et al. 2014</xref>). More recent reports demonstrated that there were profound changes in the relative abundance of “core” taxa and composition within the subgingival microbiota that extend beyond the species previously associated with periodontitis (<xref rid="bibr20-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>). In that regard, a distinct partitioning of bacterial communities is commonly found within healthy and diseased periodontal sites (<xref rid="bibr10-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Griffen et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
              <p>The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is to reverse the oral ecological regime shift from a state of dysbiosis and to reinstall stable homeostasis with the host immune system (<xref rid="bibr24-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Moutsopoulos and Konkel 2018</xref>). Conventional periodontal therapy induces microbial community changes: nevertheless, these remain short-lasting (<xref rid="bibr30-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Sanchez et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. 2019</xref>). More pronounced shifts in oral microbial ecology may result from adjunctive treatments, such as a full-mouth disinfection approach or use of systemic antibiotics, compared to mechanical debridement alone (<xref rid="bibr7-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">De Soete et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
              <p>Recently, an interesting approach for altering dysbiotic microbiota has received attention in the treatment of intestinal diseases. After cleaning the entire dysbiotic gut microbiota, fecal microbiota transplantations (FMTs) from healthy donors have been used to establish a health-compatible microbiota in recipients (<xref rid="bibr17-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al. 2017</xref>). Initially, FMT was recommended for the treatment of persistent <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">C-diff</italic>) infections (<xref rid="bibr4-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Cammarota et al. 2017</xref>), but its application expanded quickly to chronic diseases associated with gut dysbiosis, such as ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="bibr32-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr6-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Costello et al. 2019</xref>). Mounting evidence from pooled analyses and randomized controlled trials supports the efficacy of FMT for the remission of ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="bibr34-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Paramsothy et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>Considering the demonstrated efficacy of FMT in treating some dysbiosis-associated gut diseases, the present study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an oral microbiota transplantation (OMT) as an adjunct to full-mouth debridement in the treatment of naturally occurring periodontitis in beagle dogs.</p>

One 4-y-old periodontally and systemically healthy female beagle dog with all 42 teeth was enrolled as the healthy oral microbiota transplant donor. Periodontitis severity was determined after inclusion and randomization into experimental groups to avoid allocation bias. Probing pocket depths (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) scores, and plaque index (PI) scores were recorded for both groups at 4 time points: 2 wk before OMT (week –2), at OMT (baseline), 2 wk after OMT (week 2), and 12 wk after OMT (week 12) by calibrated examiners under general anesthesia. Animals were housed at the Animal Research Facility of Heinrich-Heine University of Dusseldorf in Germany. To prevent any unintended transmission of oral microbiota, dogs were separated from each other during the study period.</p>

                <p>To reduce periodontal inflammation, all dogs in both groups received full-mouth supra- and subgingival debridement using sonic scalers and hand instruments as well as full-mouth glycine powder air polishing (GPAP) 2 wk before baseline (week 2; <xref rid="fig1-0022034521995423" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

At baseline, this procedure was repeated except for the donor dog. To further suppress the resident oral microbiota, additional subgingival and oral irrigation with 0.1% NaOCl was performed for 5 min (<xref rid="bibr35-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Slots 2002</xref>).

                <p>The donor microbiota was collected prior to mechanical debridement from supragingival biofilms of all teeth and mucosal surfaces using a hand curette and a cotton swab under general anesthesia at week 2. At baseline, the donor dog was sedated and supragingival biofilms from all teeth and mucosal surfaces were harvested on 1 side of the mouth as described. The samples were pooled and suspended in sterile reduced transport medium. An aliquot was reserved for microbiome analysis at each visit. The collected oral microbiota was dispersed by vortexing and used immediately for transplantation to 1 dog of the test group. Test dogs were inoculated with OMT by continuous subgingival and oral irrigation over a period of 10 min. The biofilms from the other side of the mouth were analogously collected on the next day and used for transplantation to a different test dog. This general procedure was repeated on pairs of test dogs over an approximately 18-mo period, waiting a minimum of 3 mo between harvesting/transplantation procedures to allow for the reestablishment of the biofilm in the donor dog. None of the dogs received oral hygiene after OMT.</p>

Outcomes following mechanical debridement in beagle dogs with naturally occurring periodontitis were used for sample size determination (<xref rid="bibr23-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al. 1979</xref>). A total of 18 dogs were needed to detect a difference of 0.8 mm in PPD with a standard deviation of 0.4 mm at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of at least 80%. The estimated power using the exact small-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distribution was 88%.</p>
                <p>Mean PPD at week 12 was used as the primary outcome variable, as there were no preliminary data about the outcomes following OMT. All other parameters were assessed as secondary outcome variables and are presented descriptively. The dog was used as the statistical unit. All data collection and analyses were conducted in a blinded manner. PPD, BOP, and PI were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher’s least significant difference test. Multivariate test statistics for microbiological analysis were performed using the R package GenePiper (<xref rid="bibr37-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Tong and Chan 2020</xref>) unless specified otherwise in the <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0022034521995423" ext-link-type="uri">appendix</ext-link>. For microbiological data, alpha-diversity measures were calculated using the alpha-diversity module and analyzed by the Wilcoxon test. Beta-diversities were analyzed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. The distance matrices were visualized in principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) ordinations and analyzed with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) tests evaluated at 9,999 random permutations. Principal response curve (PRC) analysis was performed using the default parameters.</p>

                <p>The median alpha-diversities of the oral microbiota in both test and control groups decreased significantly between the week –2 and baseline time points (<italic toggle="yes">P </italic>≤ 0.01, <xref rid="fig2-0022034521995423" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0022034521995423" ext-link-type="uri">Appendix Table 1</ext-link>). Alpha-diversity levels fell further between baseline and week 2 in the test group but increased in the control group, without statistical significance. For both groups, the levels of alpha-diversity were significantly lower at week 2 compared to week –2, with considerably stronger statistical support for the test group than the control group (<italic toggle="yes">P </italic>≤ 0.001 vs. <italic toggle="yes">P </italic>≤ 0.05, <xref rid="fig2-0022034521995423" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). There was a statistically significant increase in the alpha-diversity levels of the test group subjects between week 2 and week 12.

                <p>The corresponding beta-diversity levels in the oral microbiota sampled from the donor, test, and control groups throughout the experiment were analyzed using multivariate ordination analyses based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and visualized in PCoA plots. The oral microbiota of the donor dog was notably distinct from the test and control dogs and demonstrated stability throughout the experimental period (<xref rid="fig3-0022034521995423" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

The effect of OMT is most apparent between the baseline and week 2 time points, with differences becoming reconciled toward the week 12 time point. Since the PRC is negative, taxa indicated with a positive score have a decrease in relative abundance in the test group compared to the controls and vice versa.

              <p>The therapeutic alteration of a dysbiotic microbiota is a challenging undertaking. Most research has thus far focused on altering the gut microbiome, for example, using FMT to treat <italic toggle="yes">C-diff</italic> (<xref rid="bibr36-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Smits et al. 2013</xref>). The composition of the donor microbiota, the genetic and immunological background of an individual recipient, and the composition and inherent resilience of the recipient’s microbiota may all notably influence the ability to make long-lasting beneficial changes to the overall microbial community structure (<xref rid="bibr39-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2019</xref>). The microbiota within periodontitis niches typically has a significantly higher species diversity when compared to healthy periodontal sites, which is in contrast to the situation typically associated with gastrointestinal health and disease (<xref rid="bibr1-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Abusleme et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2018</xref>). Consistent with this relationship, the oral microbiota harvested from the donor dog had significantly lower alpha-diversity levels than test and control dogs. It should be noted that there was considerable heterogeneity in the oral microbiota in both the test and control dogs at baseline, which introduces variability to the results. This observation is consistent with the oral microbiota associated with human periodontitis, which similarly exhibits considerable compositional variability (<xref rid="bibr18-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Kirst et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>Research on therapeutic approaches for dysbiotic oral microbiome engineering (oral microbiome transplants) has been conducted almost exclusively in murine models (<xref rid="bibr13-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Hajishengallis et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al. 2019</xref>). The murine oral microbiota typically exhibits considerable resilience and regenerative capacity in response to (chemo)therapeutic challenges. For example, an established dysbiotic microbiota demonstrated stability to antibiotic treatment in a murine experiment of vertical and horizontal oral dysbiotic microbiota transfer (<xref rid="bibr27-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al. 2019</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that a large reduction in the endogenous microbiota populations prior to treatment would be crucial to increase engraftment success of a transplanted microbiota. To achieve this, we conducted a full-mouth debridement and disinfection prior to transplantation to deplete the local microbial communities. However, such procedures are known to generally result in large-scale changes to the oral microbiome, which generally last several weeks, before returning to compositions similar to that originally present (<xref rid="bibr11-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Haffajee et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. 2019</xref>). As expected, full-mouth debridement resulted in a significant reduction in alpha-diversity levels in dogs from both groups, along with a notable change in respective microbiome compositions.</p>
              <p>The lowering of alpha-diversity putatively corresponds to a less dysbiotic periodontal microbiome at baseline. The oral microbiota in the test group showed a closer resemblance to the microbiota of the healthy donor, evidenced by its lower alpha-diversity and changes in its ASV composition. These changes indicate that a single OMT had notably modulated the recipient microbiota composition. However, the impact of a single OMT was transient. We postulate that the increase in alpha-diversity in the test group at week 12 may be due to the resilience of the recipient’s well-established “pro-dysbiotic” microbiota counteracting the newly transplanted microbiota. In addition, the lack of oral hygiene may also have negatively influenced the colonization and establishment of the transplanted microbiota and exacerbated the high BOP and PI scores throughout the observation period. Results from FMT treatments have shown that there are notable donor-specific effects, for example, where microbiome explants from “super-donors” may be particularly effective at producing long-lasting (beneficial) changes to the recipient’s microbiome (<xref rid="bibr39-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. 2019</xref>). Yet, a single transplantation may be not sufficient to effect long-lasting changes in highly resilient oral microbial populations. Multiple OMTs may be required to sustain “pro-homeostatic” changes to the recipient’s dysbiotic oral microbiota (<xref rid="bibr38-0022034521995423" ref-type="bibr">Utter et al. 2016</xref>). Moreover, the mucosae of the gut and oral cavity have highly distinct anatomical and physiological characteristics, and the resident microbiota most probably responds very differently to various OMT regimens.</p>
              <p>The results of this dog study demonstrated that a single OMT from a periodontally healthy donor as an adjunct to mechanical and chemical full-mouth debridement has an additional modulatory effect on the composition of the oral microbiota in dogs with naturally occurring periodontitis than full-mouth mechanical and antimicrobial debridement alone. However, the effect of a single OMT was transient in nature, with the microbial composition returning to pretreatment levels after 12 wk. Future studies employing alternative transplantation strategies (e.g., with test subjects receiving multiple “healthy” OMT donations over a specific time period) are critically required to further assess the potential for OMT in the treatment of periodontal diseases.</p>
