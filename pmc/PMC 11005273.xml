                  <p id="Par2">A non-inferior split-mouth design was considered. A pre-calculated sample size of 96 molars (48 per group) with class-2 cavities of twenty-one children whose ages ranged from 5 to 10 years were randomly included in the trial. Pre-operative Plaque Index (PI), DMFT/dmft scores and the time required to fill the cavity were recorded. Over 24 months, the teeth were clinically evaluated every six months and radiographically every 12 months by two calibrated and blinded evaluators using the United States public health service (USPHS)-Ryge criteria. The two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in success rate was considered to assess non-inferiority, and the margin was set at -18%. The linear mixed model and Firth’s logistic regression model were used for data analysis (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par6">After 24 months, 86 teeth (43 per group) were evaluated. The mean PI score was 1.1(± 0.9), while DMFT/dmft was 0.35 (± 0.74) and 6.55 (± 2.25) respectively. The clinical and radiographic success rate of Dyract vs. ACTIVA was 95.3% and 88.3% vs. 93% and 86%, respectively. The two-sided 95% CI for the difference in success rate (-2.3%) was − 3.2 to 1.3% and didn’t reach the predetermined margin of -18% which had been anticipated as the non-inferiority margin. Clinically, ACTIVA had a significantly better colour match (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) but worse marginal discolouration (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0143). There were no significant differences regarding other clinical or radiographic criteria (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). ACTIVA took significantly less placement time than Dyract, with a mean difference of 2.37 (± 0.63) minutes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par8">The performance of ACTIVA was not inferior to Dyract and both materials had a comparable high clinical and radiographic performance in children with high-caries experience. ACTIVA had a significantly better colour match but more marginal discolouration. It took significantly less time to be placed in the oral cavity.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par9">Developing a suitable dental material is challenging as restorative dentistry becomes less invasive and more bioactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Difficulties can be encountered when treating uncooperative children or using restorative materials with different restorative clinical steps. These difficulties are even more pronounced in paediatric dentistry in children with high caries experience and uncooperative behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, several restorative materials have been introduced in paediatric dentistry to overcome these issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Among them are compomers. They are widely used and evaluated in primary dentition, with proven high clinical success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, they do not retain any bioactive properties that might help to remineralise and bond to the remaining dentine structure. They require several pre-treatment steps and a multi-layering technique, which might be less attractive for some practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. .</p>
              <p id="Par11">Resin-based composites (RBC) have been used due to their superior mechanical, aesthetic, and adhesion properties. However, shrinkage with subsequent microleakage remains a major problem, in addition to lack of the remaining tooth structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Glass ionomers cements (GIC) are also popular in paediatric dentistry for their simple application, fluoride release, and less moisture sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, they might have inferior mechanical properties, worse marginal adaptation, and a higher risk of restoration failure compared to RBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Bulk-fill resin composites that could be placed in a single increment of 4–5 mm have been developed to simplify the restoration procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This procedure is also less susceptible to technical errors that arise from void incorporation between the composite increments, causing incomplete unity of the filling restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Bulk-fill resin composites have shown similar clinical behaviour to conventional incremental RBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Another innovation is incorporating bioactive components to improve the tooth-filling bond, along with the traditional adhesion, through forming and integrating hydroxy apatite crystals within the dentinal tubules, thereby reducing the odds of marginal leakage and further secondary caries formation. In addition, the remineralisation potential of affected hard dental tissue may be beneficial in children with high caries experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">ACTIVA BioACTIVE is an ionic composite resin that combines the biocompatibility, chemical bond, and the remineralising and fluoride-releasing ability of glass ionomer cement (GIC) with the mechanical properties, aesthetics, and durability of RBC. It can be placed in a single increment of 4–5 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, it is claimed that this material has bioactive properties due to its bioactive fillers. However, this claim has no conclusive evidence to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In vivo, ACTIVA had a similar performance up to one year follow-up period compared to bulk-fill composite and Giomer hybrid composite in primary dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and to nanohybrid composite in permanent dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Such a restorative material as ACTIVA might provide a reliable alternative treatment to the traditional restorative procedure with improved mechanical properties, bioactivity, ability to release fluoride, and the possibility of placement in 4–5 mm increments. However, up to date, there is scarce information in the literature about this restorative material, and there needs to be more reliable in vivo studies with long follow-up periods. Therefore, this study’s primary outcome is evaluating the clinical and radiographic performance of ACTIVA in class-II restorations in primary molars compared to a compomer (Dyract) in vivo based on non-inferiority assumption. The secondary outcomes are comparing the time needed for placement of ACTIVA in the cavity to Dyract and assessing the oral hygiene progression over time. The null hypothesis is that the clinical and radiographic performance of ACTIVA is inferior to Dyract.</p>

                <p id="Par18">To compare ACTIVA and Dyract in vivo, a monocenter, non-inferiority prospective double-blinded (patient and evaluator) split-mouth randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in Ghent University Hospital and reported according to CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

                <p id="Par20">At the time of sample size calculation, no in vivo information on ACTIVA was available in the literature. Therefore, a 6-months pilot study involving placement of 20 ACTIVA class-II restorations (other than the included restorations in the main trial) in primary molars was conducted, which resulted in a 95% clinical success rate.</p>

Since this variation was showed by the standard treatment, the performance of ACTIVA was considered non-inferior if the success rate, including 95% confidence interval (CI), falls within this variation. Therefore, for the comparison between Dyract and ACTIVA, Δ = -18% was defined as the non-inferiority margin.</p>

                <p id="Par23">Recruited teeth were randomly assigned following simple procedure to either of the two groups (ACTIVA or Dyract) based on pre-generated sequence. The sequence was generated by an independent person using Random Integer Generator (RANDOM.ORG, Randomness and Integrity Services Ltd.). These sequences were kept in sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes and the operator was unaware. The allocation ratio was set to be equal between both treatment groups (1:1) by recruiting an equal number of carious teeth on each side of each subject’s mouth. The required teeth were not always matched and could be the first or second molar from both the upper and lower jaw to recruit as many teeth as possible. In each visit, a quadrant is prepared for material placement while the operator was blinded until the material placement. Then, a second person opened the sealed envelope, revealed the type of restoration, and assigned participant to intervention, as both materials have a distinguished application method. In the second visit, the other side is prepared, and the second person disclosed the treatment. Both participants and evaluators were also blinded to intervention by replacing the type of treatment in the patient’s dossier by code which is only known by the independent person who conducted the randomisation. When the trial is completed and all teeth were evaluated, the independent person replaced the codes with the type of treatment and matched the groups.</p>

                <p id="Par29">One master student treated all children to avoid inter-operator bias. A pre-operative bitewing radiograph was taken for diagnosis (as part of the routine dental check-up). The tooth was anesthetised using local anaesthesia (Septanest Normal 4% articaine with 1/200,000 adrenaline, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) and isolated using a rubber dam (Isodam, Sigma dental, Derbyshire, UK). Class II restorations were prepared using a high-speed diamond pear bur (ISO 806 314 234 524) with ample water spray. A low-speed carbide round bur (H1.204.014) or hand excavator was used to remove further deeper caries.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Subsequently, a metal matrix band (V3 Sectional Matrix System™, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) and a wooden wedge were placed interdentally. At this point, the tooth was assigned to the allocated group according to randomisation, and both restorative materials were placed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
                <p id="Par31">The cavity was etched with 35% phosphoric acid (Ultra-Etch®, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) for 20 s and then washed and dried. Next, a bonding agent (Prime &amp; Bond NT, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) was applied and cured for 10 s. Dyract was placed in layers up to 2 mm, while ACTIVA was placed in bulk up to 4 mm.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Both materials were cured using a light-cure source (Satelec Mini LED curing light, A-dec Inc., Newberg, USA) with a light intensity of 1250 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and wavelength 420–480 nm for 20 s. Finally, the material was finished using a diamond finishing bur (ISO198/018 TR-13EF) and polished using a silicon rubber polishing bur, and the occlusion was checked for any interferences using articulating paper.</p>

                <p id="Par39">A two-sided 95% CI for the difference in success rate was used to assess non-inferiority. A generalised linear mixed model and Firth’s logistic regression model were used to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes. The material, follow-up visit, and jaw were considered the main variables in all models. In addition, the interaction between “material” and “visit” was tested for significance to determine whether the evolution of the responses over time (visits) is different for the two materials.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Before building each model, it was decided whether to consider an intercept and a slope for each patient. This was done by considering two intercept-only models: one with random intercepts and one with both random intercepts and slopes. Both models were then compared, and when no difference in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was found, the simpler model with random intercepts was chosen. If the difference in AIC between the two models was greater than 4, the models were considered different, and the model with the smaller AIC was accepted to provide a better fit. The “bglmer” function from the blme package was used, allowing a penalized maximum likelihood estimation method to account for the low frequencies present for the response categories of interest.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par53">Dyract was chosen as the control group because it is widely used, and its performance in primary dentition is well documented. A split-mouth design was adopted because it allows each subject to act as its control and requires less sample size for the same power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, no cross-contamination that might lead to false positive results is expected, as the treatment effect is confined to the treated tooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The recruited teeth from both sides of the mouth were matched as much as possible, meaning both first and second molars from the upper and lower jaws were included. Tooth anatomy, size, and position in the mouth might affect the restoration performance but would allow including more teeth. Nevertheless, no statistical significance was found in the restoration performance or placement time between the first and second molar, and between the upper and lower jaw. The calculated sample size of 35 teeth per group was based on the success rate of Dyract from the literature, which ranged between 14 and 104 teeth with a mean of 50 teeth per group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">The population represented by the included subjects comprised mainly children with a high caries experience and a fair baseline oral hygiene. These findings indicate that both materials would perform equally or better in a normal population with better oral hygiene status. In addition, the PI scores had improved at the 1-year follow-up visit, most probably due to the repeated oral hygiene instructions and follow-up.</p>
              <p id="Par55">The clinical and radiographic success rates of ACTIVA were not inferior to Dyract and within the non-inferiority margin. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. The clinical success rate of Dyract was consistent with other studies. Hse and Wei reported a 95% clinical success over 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], Gross et al. reported 96% over 24 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], while Ertugul et al. reported 95.7% over the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Other studies have reported success rates ranging between 78% and 96% (mean 87%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">ACTIVA was evaluated in vivo for a 12-month follow-up period. Bhadra et al. reported a failure of 2 out of 28 analysed teeth, with a clinical performance comparable to nanohybrid composite in permanent dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Deepika et al. reported no failure in the primary dentition, only a change in the colour and marginal discolouration, which was consistent with our study. However, the clinical performance was better compared to Giomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Lardani et al. reported 2% failure with a performance comparable to SDR for both functional and aesthetic properties in the primary dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par57">The wide variation in success rates in literature could be due to differences in the follow-up period (one to three years), the type of the study (split-mouth, RCT or non-RCT) where different statistics were used, operator experience, the use of rubber dam, and evaluator’s reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Patient’s age and cooperation are other factors contributing to outcome differences. An 11-months median survival time of restorations placed in 3-year-old children was reported. This value increased to 44 months when studied in children aged 7 to 8 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Only cooperative children aged between 5 and 10 years were included in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par58">Over the 24 months, Dyract went through significantly more colour changes than ACTIVA, which is probably related to abrasive surface wear and pH fluctuations. When Dyract was abraded with a toothbrush, it suffered the highest mass loss and the most significant reduction in surface hardness compared to a flowable and hybrid resin composite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. When Dyract was exposed to Coca-Cola and orange juice, unfavourable colour changes of more than ΔE = 11.0 were seen compared to composite resin. This can be explained by the low pH that softens the surface of the compomer, resulting in the separation of structural ions from the glass phase. Subsequently, individual particles dissociate, leaving a rough surface with voids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. When ACTIVA was immersed in different consumable solutions, it maintained a clinically acceptable colour (ΔE 3.0–8.0) which was better than Filtek nanocomposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], Giomer and Fuji II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] but worse than Filtek nanohybrid composite resin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which indicates that ACTIVA is more composite than RM-GIC.</p>
              <p id="Par59">On the other hand, ACTIVA exhibited a more pronounced marginal discolouration than Dyract. This could be due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the restoration and the tooth structure. Due to the force of mastication and the intake of hot and cold consumables, a negative interfacial pressure is generated, forcing the oral fluid to infiltrate into the margins and causing some degree of discolouration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This was observed when ACTIVA was compared to Filtek™ Supreme Ultra resin composite and showed more marginal discolouration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This phenomenon results in an increased degree of microleakage, which might explain the failed teeth in the ACTIVA group due to secondary caries.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Furthermore, when the bonding step was omitted, ACTIVA showed a worse marginal adaptation than Ceram X Mono in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and an annual failure rate of 24.1% after one year in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Therefore, placing ACTIVA without pre-treating the cavity with etch-and-bond systems is highly discouraged. Nevertheless, in this study, all cavities were pre-treated, and the difference in marginal adaptation between both materials was not significant. No clinical secondary caries was found in the Dyract group at any point, although the reported main reason for failure for compomer in the primary dentition is secondary caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par61">ACTIVA significantly took 2.37 ± 0.63 min less than Dyract to be placed in the prepared cavities as it can be placed in bulk up to 4 mm increments. This is due to the monomer composition and the chemical cure resin in ACTIVA, which allows the material to set fully even in the deeper layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In contrast, the light cure is essential to initiate the setting reaction of Dyract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In addition, Dyract has to be condensed and adjusted to mould the anatomy. ACTIVA, which is flowable, requires less handling, resulting in a shorter working time. Considering that the cavities in the current study were all class II, no cusp build-up or extensive restorations were performed.</p>
              <p id="Par62">The application time difference of 2.37 min between the two materials may have had only a limited impact compared to the total period for the dental visit. Still, those two minutes are tangled in the most critical part of the dental visit. The cavity should stay dry, while the child usually has been on the chair for a while and should stay still and keep his mouth open. Therefore, reducing the treatment time by two minutes could be interesting to shorten the most technique-sensitive step in the procedure.</p>
              <p id="Par63">One of the limitations of this study is that the operator was only blinded until material placement, as both interventions have different application procedures. The sample size was considerably small compared to other studies, and the in vivo efficiency of the bioactive properties of ACTIVA could not be demonstrated in the final results, probably due to the short follow-up period. Therefore, clinical studies with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods are essential to assess the ability of a bioactive restorative material to prevent secondary caries or stop the active progression.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par64">The performance of ACTIVA was not inferior to Dyract and both materials had a comparable high 24-month clinical and radiographic performance in children with high-caries experience. ACTIVA took significantly less time than Dyract to be placed in the oral cavity, which could be of interest for the dentist to reduce the chairside time.</p>
