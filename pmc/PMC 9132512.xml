              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Dentinal hypersensitivity is one of the most common clinical conditions encountered by most of the general practitioners characterized by “short, sharp pain arising from the exposed dentin in response to any stimuli which can be thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic or chemical that cannot be ascribed to any other dental defect or pathology.”[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Different terms have been used to describe dentinal hypersensitivity like cervical/root/cemental/dentine hypersensitivity/dentine sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Dentinal hypersensitivity is a prevalent disorder and is one of the most unbearable conditions among the patients which can lead to both physical and psychological discomfort for the patient having a negative effect on the quality of a person's life, especially with regard to the selection of diet and hygiene maintenance. It has been found to be more prevalent among the population with the incident rate of about 4%–74% with it being more common among the females than in males with the peak of 30–40 years of age in canines followed by premolars being the most commonly affected teeth.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p>
              <p>Several attempts have been made to treat hypersensitivity either by desensitizing the nerve, forming precipitates of protein within the tubules, sealing/plugging the dentinal tubules or by laser therapy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Commonly used desensitizing agents are Potassium Nitrate, Glutaraldehyde, Silver Nitrate, Sodium fluoride, Strontium Chloride, Zinc Chloride, Methyl methacrylate, and Silver diamine fluoride.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Potassium nitrate acts by preventing the nerve from getting depolarized and the entrance of sodium ions into the nerve thereby reduces the level of sensitivity[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Gluma is a combination of glutaraldehyde and hydroxyethyl methacrylate which acts by coagulating the proteins within the dentinal tubules and thereby decreasing the level of sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Silver diamine fluoride solution is been used as therapeutic agent at a concentration of about 38% for the management of dental caries which has a ph of 8–9.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, its prevalence as a desensitizer following vital tooth preparation is less among the general practitioners as they are not aware of the pros and cons of the material. Application of the solution topically on the exposed dentinal surface resulted in the formation of squamous layer plugging the dentinal tubules, thereby reducing the dentinal hypersensitivity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] And so, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of silver diamine fluoride, potassium nitrate, and glutaraldehyde in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity following vital tooth preparation. The secondary objectives of this study are to observe for any incidences of debonding and hypersensitivity following cementation of the definitive prosthesis and after a follow-up period. The null hypothesis is that there is no measurable difference in the reduction of Hypersensitivity following vital tooth preparation on using silver diamine fluoride than potassium nitrate and glutaraldehyde.</p>

              <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
              <p>This study was conducted among the patients who were referred to the Department of Prosthodontics, IGIDS for crown and bridge prosthesis in vital tooth during the period of May 2019 to Dec 2020. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB No: IGIDSIRB2018NRP40PGSAPRI) and Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC No: IGIDSIEC2018NRP40PGSAPRI). Trial was registered in clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI-REF/2020/01/031226). 119 teeth of 68 patients who met the inclusion criteria participated in the study [<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]. Informed consent were obtained from all the participants before the recruitment in the study. The sample size for the study was estimated by a statistician and block randomization was generated using computer software. Patients were allocated and assigned into any of the 4 groups (Control, Silver diamine fluoride, potassium nitrate, and glutaraldehyde). The details of the Materials and equipment used are shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Addy <italic>et al</italic>. defined Hypersensitivity as a transient short and sharp pain which occurred as a result of the exposure of dentinal tubules in response to any stimuli.</p>
              <p>In situations, where the vital tooth is prepared to receive a definitive prosthesis, the dentin is exposed and left uncovered for a sufficient period till the provisional crown is fabricated.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] After the definitive prosthesis is fabricated, the provisional crown and the residual cement remaining on the tooth structure are removed.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Definitive prosthesis made of either metal or ceramic material will be tried to check the accuracy of fit, marginal adaptation, proximal contours, and occlusion.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] All the above-mentioned instances happen in regular clinical practice and the patient is comforted stating that the sensitivity is a transient phenomenon. During cementation of the prosthesis, acidic luting agents may sometimes increase the sensitivity and cause intolerable discomfort to the patient.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The entire procedure becomes an uncomfortable experience for the patient. Using desensitizing agents for dentin exposure due to caries and noncarious lesions as already mentioned is very well recorded in literature. Following tooth preparation, many desensitizing agents have been recommended for use.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Though hypersensitivity and desensitizing agents are not novel to the dental profession, its use following tooth preparation to handle postpreparation sensitivity does not have enough literature to support. We find many articles in the literature on the use of desensitizing agents to reduce hypersensitivity for conditions like carious and noncarious lesions.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Very few evidences exist on the use of various desensitizing agents following vital tooth preparation. In 2009, Jatalian <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a study to find out the effectiveness of the desensitizers in reducing the post vital tooth preparation dentinal hypersensitivity and found that Potassium nitrate used before cementation reduced postoperative vital tooth preparation sensitivity than GLUMA. The knowledge and practice of such desensitizing agents following vital tooth preparation is less among the general practitioners as there are no much literature evidence. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of silver diamine fluoride, potassium nitrate, and glutaraldehyde in the reduction of post vital tooth preparation hypersensitivity.</p>
              <p>Comparison of the dentinal hypersensitivity among the four groups (water, silver diamine fluoride, potassium nitrate, glutaraldehyde) showed the same value before preparation indicating that there is no meaningful statistical difference (<italic>P</italic> = 1.000) between the groups which determined the equality of the characteristics of the groups at the start of the procedure. Furthermore, as per the inclusion criteria, the rate of sensitivity in all the samples of the four groups is found to be before the preparation.</p>
              <p>When silver diamine fluoride is used as desensitizer, comparison of the rate of hypersensitivity at five different intervals (before preparation, after preparation, after application of desensitizing agents, before cementation of the definitive prosthesis and after a follow-up period of about 30 days) revealed a highly significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). The least amount of sensitivity is observed before cementation of the definitive prosthesis and marked difference is noted after preparation. No report of sensitivity is observed after the follow-up period (mean = 0.00). Thus, Silver diamine fluoride when used as desensitizer reduced the level of hypersensitivity immediately after application and over time with no sensitivity reported after follow-up period indicating that it has a long-term effect. When using Potassium nitrate as a desensitizer, comparison of the degree of hypersensitivity at 5 different intervals (Before preparation, After preparation, after application of desensitizing agents, before cementation of the definitive prosthesis, and after a follow-up period of about 30 days) showed a highly significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). Least amount of hypersensitivity is observed after a follow-up period of 30 days and most is noted after preparation. Thus, Potassium Nitrate when used as a desensitizer reduced the degree of hypersensitivity immediately after application of the agent and over time indicating that it has a long term effect. When using GLUMA as a desensitizer, comparison of the degree of hypersensitivity at 5 different intervals (Before preparation After preparation, After application of desensitizing agents, before cementation of the definitive prosthesis and after a follow-up period of about 30 days) revelead a highly significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). Least amount of sensitivity was observed after a follow-up period of about 30 days and most was after preparation. Thus, GLUMA as a desensitizer reduced the rate of hypersensitivity immediately after application and over time indicating that it has a long-term effect. Comparing the degree of sensitivity in the control group at 5 different intervals (Before preparation, After preparation, After application of desensitizing agents, prior to cementation of the definitive prosthesis and after a follow up period of about 30 days) showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). Water is applied as a control instead of desensitizing agent and sensitivity on the abutment teeth is measured at different intervals. It was found that least amount of sensitivity is observed after a follow-up period and is most after preparation and application. The reduction in hypersensitivity occurred slowly over time which may be due to the sclerotic dentin formation as a result of constant stimulation. Thus, it can be concluded that there is little reduction in the level of hypersensitivity over time even without the use of desensitizers. When compared to the instantaneous effect of the desensitizers in other groups, the effect seems to be very little and occurs gradually over time. It was found that there is a highly statistically significant difference between the four groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) after the application of desensitizing agents (silver diamine fluoride, potassium nitrate, GLUMA) and the control group. Comparison of the desensitizing agents and the control group showed that there is the significant reduction in the rate of hypersensitivity after application of desensitizing agents. Least amount of sensitivity after application of the agents is observed in the Silver diamine fluoride group followed by GLUMA and potassium nitrate and higher degree of sensitivity was observed in the control group. Comparison of the degree of sensitivity before cementation of the prosthesis among the four groups (Control, silver diamine fluoride, potassium nitrate and GLUMA) showed a highly significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) between the four groups. The least amount of sensitivity prior to the cementation of the prosthesis was observed in silver diamine fluoride group followed by potassium nitrate and GLUMA and most was observed in Control group. Null hypothesis was rejected as there were significant difference in the reduction of hypersensitvity using silver diamine fluoride than potassium nitrate and glutaraldehyde. To the extent of our knowledge, this was the first report which compared the efficacy of silver diamine fluoride in the reduction of post vital tooth preparation hypersensitivity. In this study, the results showed that silver diamine fluoride was superior to the other desensitizing agents in reducing the pain and discomfort among the patients at four different intervals. The null hypothesis which was stated at the start of the study is rejected as there is highly significant difference on using silver diamine fluoride in reducing the post vital tooth preparation hypersensitivity than the potassium nitrate and GLUMA. However, of the 34 treated with gluma desensitizer 12 of them showed mild pulsating pain which can be considered as one of the side effects of the material. One of the limitations of the current randomized controlled trial is the sample size and a longer follow-up period is needed to evaluate the significant difference between the materials. Further Randomized control studies with longer follow-up period are needed to evaluate the effect of silver diamine fluoride as a desensitizer in reducing the post vital tooth preparation hypersensitivity.</p>
