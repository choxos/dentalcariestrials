              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">Dental anxiety is excessive fear created by the thought of visiting the dentist for dental treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Factors such as the patient’s age, gender, educational level, profession, previous experiences, socio-economic status, and geography may each play a role in its etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although there have been many innovations and developments in the field of dentistry in recent years, some patients do not know how to cope with dental anxiety, and therefore, they delay dental treatments. For this reason, it has been determined that anxious dental patients are more likely to have dental caries, gingival diseases, and bad oral hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. If dental anxiety is controlled, the oral and dental health of patients will improve significantly.</p>
              <p id="Par7">As a result of anxiety, mydriasis (dilation in pupils), increased heart rate (tachycardia), high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), increased body temperature, high cholesterol, increased cortisol secretion, and decreased oxygen saturation values (desaturation) may be seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To reduce dental anxiety and therefore these symptoms, premedication, sedation, distraction, hypnosis, and music therapy can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Music therapy is a non-invasive, economical, effective intervention method to reduce the anxiety level of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It may exert its effect on subjective anxiety scales and objective physiologic parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and cortisol hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">In dentistry, music can reduce dental anxiety and pain, which are linked closely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Music listening might also activate imagery, offering an escape from the stressful condition. Anxiety often increases before the dental treatment starts. Visit purpose and waiting room experience, specifically the amount of time waiting for the treatment and the waiting room environment, are the factors which may cause dental anxiety prior to restorative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, on a psychosocial level, music provides the patient an aesthetic experience that can offer comfort and peace while awaiting and during dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) is a questionnaire with five questions to classify dentally anxious participants. Each question has five different response options ranging from a score of 1 (not anxious) to 5 (extremely anxious). The MDAS sum score has a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For scores 5–9, participants are classified as not dentally anxious or slightly anxious, and thus, they do not need any intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The people whose scores are higher than 19 are deemed highly anxious, and they may be treated with more complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Participants with scores between 10 and 18 are defined as having moderate dental anxiety. It is especially expressed that individuals with moderate dental anxiety may benefit principally from noninvasive methods, such as listening to music [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Restorative dentistry has a strong correlation with both pre-treatment dental anxiety and fear of pain during treatment. The patient’s subjective reactions to restorative dentistry procedures such as local anesthesia, cavity preparation, the pressure applied to the tooth, the vibrations and noise recorded, the heat and smell generated at the interface between the tooth and the bur, and the time taken cause anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although studies have examined the effects of music therapy in various fields of dentistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], no study has looked at its effects on patients with moderate dental anxiety during restorative treatment. For these reasons, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of listening to music during restorative dental treatments on patients with moderate dental anxiety. The results obtained will shed light on the effect of music therapy as an anxiety reduction method.</p>

              <p id="Par11">The present study is a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial. This study was approved for its medical ethics with protocol number 2020/41 by the Karadeniz Technical University Rectorate KTU Faculty of Medicine Scientific Research Ethics Committee. The study was carried out between January 2021 and January 2022. It was conducted in the Karadeniz Technical University Faculty of Dentistry (Department of Restorative Dentistry). The study followed the Declaration of Helsinki on medical protocol and ethics. The methodology was performed within the parameters of the CONSORT statement guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="784_2023_4966_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Subjects and sample size</title>
                <p id="Par12">The GPower program was used to calculate the sample size. The sample size was calculated based on the results of the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], by taking into consideration the salivary cortisol levels in terms of differences in control and experimental groups. A sample calculation was made by providing an alpha error = 0.05, beta error = 0.20, and the effect size as 0.74. The minimum required sample was calculated as 30 people for each group. Moreover, regarding the potential data loss (approximately 20%), the final total sample size was obtained as 70 (<italic>n</italic> = 35 for each group).</p>
                <p id="Par13">Using the MDAS in Turkish, individuals with moderate dental anxiety scores (between 10 and 18) were determined. Intraoral examinations of all patients had been performed, and their panoramic radiographies had been taken before the day of dental treatment. All participants were informed about the aim of the present study. Both male and female patients who were older than 18 years of age, did not need an emergency dental treatment, had at least one case of occlusal dental caries, did not use any medication, and did not have a systemic, chronic, endocrine, and mental disease were included in the study. Smokers were also included in the study. Those patients with hearing loss, having any physical disability, who were pregnant, and who were lactating were excluded. Patients who had any prior experience with treating dentist were excluded from the study. Moreover, teeth with dental cavities in the adjacent teeth where the rubber dam would not be placed and dental caries closer than 1 mm to the pulp tissue were not included in the study.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Patients who wanted to take part in the research voluntarily signed an informed consent form. They were divided into two groups by an allocation concealment process (using sealed/opaque envelopes). The control group contained the ones who did not listen to music. The experimental group contained the ones who did listen to music.</p>
                <p id="Par15">The patients were asked to quit smoking 2 h before their dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They were also asked to stop drinking tea, coffee, and alcohol 24 h before their dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Since heavy exercise may affect salivary cortisol, patients were told to come to the appointment without having done any heavy exercise 24 h before the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <title>Treatment of patients in the control group</title>
                <p id="Par16">All cases and measurements were performed by the same restorative treatment specialist (E. K.) who had 4 years of experience. Patients did not have any prior experience with treating dentist before. Patients who came to the clinic on the day of their treatment rested in the dentist chair for 5 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Their gender, marital status, educational status, age, height, and weight were recorded. Blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation, and salivary cortisol levels of the patients were measured before their treatments. During the treatment session, the dentist (E. K.) communicated with the patient only for the procedure and cooperation. The dentist (E. K.) recorded the started treatment time on a paper. While posterior superior alveolar nerve block anesthesia was performed for maxillary molars, inferior alveolar nerve block anesthesia was performed for mandibular molars in a standardized manner. The sixth mandibular and maxillary molars were supplemented by infiltration injections. No positive aspirations, which affected the results, occurred. Only one carpule of local anesthetic without vasoconstrictor (Safecaine, Vem İlaç San. ve Tic. Anonim Şirketi, Turkey) was applied in total by a disposable dental syringe to the patients. The rubber dam was placed on the tooth. After the tooth decay was cleaned and the appropriate form was given to the cavity, the heart rate, body temperature, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were re-measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Then, the restoration phase began. Acid etching (OptiBond, Kerr, California, USA) was applied to the enamel of the teeth for 30 s using selective etching and then washed. The cavity was dried. Dental bonding (Single Bond Universal Adhesive, 3M ESPE, USA) was applied and light cured according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Dental composite resin (Filtek P60, 3M ESPE, USA) was cured for 20 s with a light curing unit (Elipar S10, 1200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 3M ESPE, Saint Paul, USA). After finishing and polishing the restoration, the rubber dam was removed. The restoration duration was recorded. The blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation, and salivary cortisol levels were re-measured, and the patients were asked to answer the MDAS again. Routine recommendations were given, and the patients’ gender, marital status, educational status, restored teeth number, age, height, and weight were recorded.</p>

                <p id="Par17">Patients who came to the clinic on the day of their treatment rested in the dentist chair for 5 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Within this period, the patients were asked their favorite music. In line with the patients’ request, their music was selected and started to play for them without headphones. It was confirmed whether they could clearly hear the sound. The sound level was adjusted according to the patients’ request so that they could hear it easily without being disturbed. They were informed that once they were ready, the dental treatment would begin. Then, the dentist (E. K.) started the treatment by measuring the parameters. Physiological measurements and restoration steps for the control group were repeated in the same way for the patients in the experimental group. Music listening continued all over the session.</p>

                <p id="Par18">While blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and body temperature were measured three times, salivary cortisol levels and MDAS responses were measured twice due to the rubber dam applied to the patients and the possibility of blood in the patients’ saliva that could cause erroneous results in the salivary cortisol measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To observe heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, oxygen saturation, body temperature changes of patients, and changes in anxiety between the stages of dental restoration, three measurements were made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]: once before, once during, and once after the restorative treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured with a manual blood pressure monitor (Perfect, Erka, Germany). The blood pressure measurements were performed on the right arm of the patients at the heart level and recorded as mmHg on a paper. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured with a finger-type portable pulse oximeter device (VZN, Ankara, Turkey) on the right index finger. The body temperature was measured on the forehead by an infrared temporal non-contact thermometer (TG8818 N, Hunan Tuogao Medical Technology, Republic of China) and recorded in Celsius.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Saliva samples were collected from each patient just before and immediately after the dental treatments. The patients were told to spit into the sterile and disposable tubes (Sali-Tubes 100 [SLV-4158], DRG, Germany). These tubes were used for the collection and storage of the unstimulated saliva samples. Half of the tubes were filled with saliva without blood contamination. The saliva samples were collected between 9:00 and 12:00 a.m. so that the measurements were not affected by the circadian rhythm and cortisol fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. After the saliva samples were collected, they were placed in a −80 °C refrigerator.</p>

In this respect, many studies have evaluated the effect of music therapy on anxiety during endodontic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], dental extractions, implant surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and restorative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, none of these studies has evaluated moderate dental anxiety. Conducting this type of study is important because restorative treatments are among the most performed dental therapies, and to our knowledge, this is the first article to investigate the effect of music on patients with moderate dental anxiety during restorative treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In this study, although there was a statistically significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, salivary cortisol, and the MDAS scores in the experimental group during dental treatment, at the end of the treatment, it was only the MDAS scores that were significantly lower than the control group. Kritsidima et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] stated that the MDAS showed both immediate and anticipatory anxiety. Humphries et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] found that the MDAS was significantly correlated with the avoidance of dental treatments. In light of these findings and the results of the present study, it can be concluded that although music therapy does not have a significant effect on physiological parameters of dental anxiety during restorative dental treatment, patients do find the effect of music on reducing dental anxiety to be positive, which could lower anxiety levels about follow-up dental treatments. This could lead to more frequent dental visits, early treatment, and better oral health and contribute to increased patient satisfaction and less pain. Thus, music therapy may be an option for patients with moderate dental anxiety during restorative dental treatments for the stated positive results, considering its ease of use and the absence of any known deleterious effects.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The MDAS is simple, easy, and practical. It is not time-consuming, and it can be implemented quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Its suitability for the Turkish population has been proven in studies, and the validity and reliability of the Turkish version were high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Moreover, the MDAS has been described as a useful tool to predict sympathetic nervous activity before the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For these reasons, we preferred the MDAS in this study. However, at the beginning of the study, the MDAS scores of both groups were 12. Because of their mild to moderate levels of anxiety, the patients may have had more control over their dental treatments and were able to manage their anxiety without music. This could be why the patients were not able to fully benefit from music therapy in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Salivary cortisol is a reliable marker of dental-related anxiety. Collecting cortisol hormones from saliva is an easy and safe method for patients and dentists. The procedure is non-invasive and practical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Salivary cortisol is highly correlated with serum cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, as cortisol is a physiologic parameter for body fluids, various factors, such as socioeconomic status, day-to-day events, previous dental experiences, and other fear-inducing factors may affect its amount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Mejia-Rubalcava et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] state that initially, both groups in their study had similar levels of salivary cortisol. However, in the second measurement, it was statistically lower in the experimental group. Wazzan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] found no significant difference in terms of salivary cortisol at the beginning and end of the study between both groups. In contrast to these, in the present study, the cortisol levels of the experimental group were higher than in the control group at the beginning and end of the study. This could be related to the experimental group containing participants who visited dentists less frequently and had more traumatic dental experiences than the others. Toward the end of the treatment, they relaxed. Another possibility is that initially, listening to music was perceived by patients as distressing. However, the significant decrease in cortisol toward the end of the treatment could indicate that they had become accustomed to the dental treatment with music therapy. The higher anxiety of the patients in the experimental group may have affected the results and caused the patients not to benefit from the music adequately.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature are physiological parameters affected by anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, there is no consensus about the effect of music therapy on these parameters. Di Nasso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] state that music therapy decreased systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate during root canal treatments. In contrast to that study, Kupeli and Gulnahar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] found no significant difference between the groups regarding heart rate and mean arterial pressure. They concluded that this could be because of the individual differences in the response of the parasympathetic nervous system during the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, Mejia-Rubalcava [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found that significant differences were registered in the systolic and diastolic pressure, heart rate, and body temperature for the experimental group, as the oxygen saturation did not change. Looking at anxiety parameters in this study, we can estimate that the patients had the highest degree of dental anxiety at the beginning of the treatment. Other than a small decrease in diastolic blood pressure in the experimental group, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature at the end of the treatment. This small decrease could also be because the patients got used to the treatment and were relieved when it was over. The second and third measurements of the pulse values in the control and experimental groups being similar also supports this.</p>
              <p id="Par34">There are some limitations to this in vivo study. The small sample size comprises mostly females and young people. Thus, it may not be a population-representative sample. The patients were not asked if they had undergone a previous dental treatment or traumatic visit before. It was also impossible to evaluate their existing psychological state, which might affect the results. Moreover, it was not confirmed if the measurement tools were valid and reliable. The patients were determined based on one questionnaire, the MDAS, and they may have exaggerated their answers. Among the anxiety parameters that can be detected in saliva, only cortisol measurements were evaluated, and the other parameters were ignored. The different salivary cortisol levels between the two groups at the beginning of the treatment may have affected the results, and during the restoration process, it was impossible to blind the patients and the researcher who performed the dental treatment. Only occlusal dental cavities on the molar teeth were restored, and the music frequency was not evaluated. Listening to the same music at different frequencies could cause different psychological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The place and measurements of the physiological parameters could have also caused more stress in the patients. The study was performed in a dental hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have impacted anxiety levels during treatments. Moreover, since it is a cross-sectional study, it may not be reliable in determining the cause-effect relationship. Confusing situations may not be determined clearly. It is suggested that future studies are conducted in consideration of these factors with substantial follow-ups to determine the effectiveness of music therapy on lowering anxiety levels.</p>
