              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP) is an inflamed pulpal tissue that can cause acute pain in response to thermal stimuli. Root canal treatment is the most common treatment for SIP (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and successful administration of local anaesthesia is essential to manage preoperative pain. Inferior alveolar nerve block is the most frequently used technique to achieve local anaesthesia in mandibular posterior teeth for endodontic treatments (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, IANB is a technique-sensitive procedure in contrast to other methods of administering local anaesthesia, making it difficult to eliminate pain effectively (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Clinical success rates for IANB in non-inflamed tissues are reported to be between 75–90 % (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), this drops substantially to 43–83 % in patients with SIP (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Consequently, patients undergoing endodontic treatment for SIP often experience intraoperative pain due to ineffective anaesthesia (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>Numerous studies have suggested that IANB alone is inadequate for managing intraoperative pain in patients with SIP and that supplementation with additional anaesthetic techniques is necessary (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). One of the most rudimentary reasons behind the ineffectiveness of IANB in SIP is the release of arachidonic acid (AA) as a consequence of inflammation (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). AA can be metabolized through lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways to produce leukotrienes or prostaglandins (PGs), respectively (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). PGs are responsible for impeding the neural response to anaesthesia (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), while leukotrienes significantly decrease patients' pain endurance and increase neutrophil influx (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Moreover, PGs also cause hyperalgesia and allodynia due to the sensitization of nerves through histamine and bradykinin (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Other reasons for IANB failure in SIP include anatomic variations, increased vasculature, anaesthesia drainage through dental sinuses, activation of nociceptors, anaesthetic solution resistance to sodium channels, blocked sodium channels due to tetrodotoxin, and localized decreases in pH (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The underlying cause of IANB failure could also be due to a decrease in the patient’s pain threshold as a result of elevated levels of anxiety (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, psychological influences can impact the perception of pain and the efficacy of anaesthetic agents (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
              <p>To address the shortcomings of IANB in managing pain in patients with SIP, various techniques have been considered, including the use of different anaesthetic agents, topical anaesthetics, and supplementary anaesthetic techniques (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Moreover, reducing pulp inflammation before local anaesthesia administration can improve efficacy. Thus, the efficacy of different opioid, steroid, and non-steroidal agents has been studied to reduce inflammation and eliminate intraoperative pain (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed by dental practitioners to alleviate mild to moderate pain associated with SIP. The administration of NSAIDs inhibits the production of PGs by blocking the COX pathway, thereby reducing pulpal inflammation and pain (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Diclofenac sodium and potassium, both derivatives of benzoic acid, are the preferred NSAIDs for moderate to severe pain due to their rapid onset of action, typically within 15–30 minutes (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Similarly, Piroxicam is an effective NSAID for dental pain as it also inhibits the COX pathway, thereby reducing PG synthesis (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Tramadol, a widely used opioid-based analgesic, can be used to treat moderate to severe acute pain (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and has been shown to mimic the effects of local anaesthetic solution. These medications are often used as a single-dose premedication to alleviate discomfort and inflammation associated with SIP and improve the efficacy of IANB.</p>
              <p>Some studies have investigated the effects of different analgesics on pain associated with SIP. Oral Diclofenac potassium and Piroxicam were found to be effective, while Tramadol showed inefficacy in managing pain associated with SIP (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, no study has compared the effects of orally administered Diclofenac sodium, Piroxicam, and Tramadol on the efficacy of IANB in patients with SIP. Therefore, this double-blinded, randomized controlled trial aims to identify the most effective preoperative drug for improving IANB efficacy in patients with SIP by comparing the effects of these different drug groups. The null hypothesis of the study is that all the preoperative analgesics have the same effect on IANB efficacy in patients with SIP.</p>

              <p>The study was approved by the ethical committee and review board of the dental institute (BDC/ERB/2021/016) and registered on the clinical trial registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier: NCT05488925). This study was written in accordance with the PRIRATE 2020 guidelines (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and all procedures adhered to the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
              <p>Sample size was determined based on previous reports (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) with a power of 0.96, effect size of 0.4, and α set at 0.05, resulting in a requirement of 30 subjects per group. Inclusion criteria comprised patients aged 18 to 65, in good systemic health, diagnosed with SIP in mandibular first and second molars with acute moderate to severe pain. Exclusion criteria included were pregnancy or nursing, periapical radiolucency, tenderness to percussion, non-restorable teeth, retreatment, open apex, resorbed roots, grade II and III mobility, intolerance to NSAIDs, and analgesics used in the past 24 hours. Non-probability consecutive sampling was performed, enrolling 120 patients who met the criteria from the outpatient department of endodontics in a private hospital. The study was thoroughly explained to the subjects and informed consent was acquired from the subjects. The treatment was conducted by a single operator with specialized training in endodontics.</p>
              <p>The study was a double-blinded, randomized, superiority trial with a parallel design. Both the operating dentist and patients were unaware of the groups of drugs that were used. This anonymity was achieved by marking A, B, C, and D on trans-opaque boxes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and patients were randomly assigned to one of the four groups using simple randomization. To ensure randomization, patients were given the choice to pick a drug from one of the labelled boxes. A cold sensibility pulp test was performed on the tooth with SIP for 10 seconds (Q-tip sprayed with Endo-Ice by HYGENIC®), and the HP VAS was used to assess pain levels immediately after the test. Pain intensities were categorized on HP VAS scale: no pain (0), mild pain (1–54 mm), moderate pain (55–114 mm), and severe pain (&gt;114 mm). Patients orally ingested a drug from the trans-opaque labelled box: group A (control, vitamin E, Evion 400 mg), group B (Diclofenac sodium, Voltral SR100 100 mg), group C (Piroxicam, Feldene 20 mg), and group D (Tramadol, Tramal, 50 mg). After 1 hour, a conventional IANB was slowly administered with Medicaine 1.8 ml of 2 % lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine (Huons Co. Ltd., Seongnam, South Korea) using a non-aspirating syringe (DentArt instruments Mfg. Co., Sialkot, Pakistan) through H-Dent long needle of 27-Gauge (Hakusui Trading Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at the rate of 2.0 ml/min. Standard root canal treatment was initiated 15 minutes after the lip numbness was achieved, and pain levels were reassessed by HP VAS during the initial filing. Patients reporting discomfort and pain during the treatment were intervened appropriately with additional local anaesthesia through local infiltration, intra-ligamentry, and/or intra-pulpal techniques. Patients who did not achieve numbness of the lips were excluded from the study. Preoperative analgesic effectiveness was determined by the difference in preoperative and intraoperative HP VAS scores.</p>

                <p>The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The Significance level (α) was set at 0.05 with a confidence interval of 95%. Normality was assessed using Shapiro Wilk test. Since the data did not meet parametric assumptions, Kruskal–Wallis test with posthoc analysis was employed. The Pearson Chi-square test was used to examine the relationship between gender and drug groups in relation to IANB efficacy.</p>

              <p>Patient recruitment began in July 2021, and the study was conducted over a 9-months period. Of the randomly included patients, 53.3% were female and 46.7% were male. The overall effectiveness of the preoperative drug in improving IANB efficacy was observed in 69.2% of patients, with the remaining 30.8% reporting pain during the root canal procedure (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Pearson Chi-squared test revealed a significant relationship between the preoperative analgesics and IANB effectiveness (p&lt;0.001). However, gender had no significant effect on IANB efficacy (p=0.616) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>The normality of the data was assessed and found not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk: p&lt;0.001). Therefore, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed with post hoc analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference in pain levels due to drug intervention between the groups (p&lt;0.001). The post hoc analysis indicated that registered pain levels differed significantly between the control group and the active drug groups (p&lt;0.001). Clinically, Piroxicam was found to show slightly higher effectiveness on IANB with SIP (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the IANB efficacy between Diclofenac sodium, Piroxicam, and Tramadol groups (p=0.906) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The study incorporated simple randomization to ensure regularity and balance among the subjects of the experimental groups. Blinding of both participants and the operator was also implemented to eliminate any potential bias. While the number of male and female subjects was not balanced, the results of the Pearson Chi-squared test revealed no significant relationship between gender and the effectiveness of preoperative analgesics on IANB. Therefore, balancing gender in the study groups was deemed unnecessary.</p>
              <p>The dosages of 100 mg Diclofenac sodium, 20 mg Piroxicam, and 50 mg Tramadol were used in accordance with earlier literature (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Vitamin E was used as a control, given its safety as a dietary supplement and lack of reported effect on local anaesthesia effectiveness. In fact, vitamin E has been reported to reduce the systemic adverse effects of lidocaine (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). HP VAS was utilized as a tool to register because of its reliability in endodontic studies. Patients were instructed to use the vas before recording their pain scores to increase consistency and minimize bias.</p>
              <p>For the purpose of achieving IANB, lidocaine was chosen as the local anaesthetic solution in this study due to its ease of availability. Although alternative agents such as articaine, mepivacaine, and prilocaine are available, their effectiveness in comparison to lidocaine is reported to be statistically insignificant (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Local anaesthesia was administered using the IANB technique one hour after the premedication was given to ensure peak plasma concentrations of the drug in the patients (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Additional anaesthetic techniques were administered to patients who did not achieve effective anaesthesia, which is in line with previous reports of the effectiveness of such supplementation in SIP patients (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, the present study did not evaluate the effectiveness of additional anaesthesia since it was beyond the scope of the study.</p>
              <p>Preoperative pain was disregarded as a confounding factor as there was no significant difference in pain levels among the test groups. While electric pulp testing and cold sensibility testing have been used in previous studies to analyse the efficacy of IANB, these techniques are not reliable during root canal treatments and were therefore not used in this study (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Instead, the clinical endodontic pulp extirpation method was implemented to test the effectiveness of preoperative analgesics on IANB.</p>
              <p>The results of this study supported the alternate hypothesis and demonstrated that preoperative analgesics significantly improved the clinical and statistical success rate of IANB compared to the control group. The anti-inflammatory effect of the analgesic drugs used in this study might be the reason for a significant anaesthetic efficacy, as these drugs act by inhibiting the formation of AA, COX, and lipoxygenase pathways, and/or PGs and leukotrienes (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). While there is a strong division among researchers regarding whether Tramadol has anti-inflammatory potential or not (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), a study suggests that Tramadol helps to achieve effective analgesia irrespective of the presence of inflammation (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>
              <p>The Kruskal-Wallis results of the present study were in harmony with previous research, which found no significant difference in the effectiveness of IANB between Piroxicam, Tramadol, and Diclofenac sodium (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Similarly, the clinical findings of the present study showed that Piroxicam was the most effective preoperative analgesic (93.3 %), followed by Tramadol (83.3 %) and Diclofenac sodium (60 %). These results align with the previous studies reporting the efficacy of Piroxicam at 90 %, Tramadol at 60 %, and Diclofenac sodium at 56–64 % on IANB (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, some studies did not support our findings. For instance, one study reported Diclofenac potassium's success rate of up to 75 %, which does not coincide with our results for Diclofenac sodium (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This could possibly mean that Diclofenac potassium is more effective in comparison to Diclofenac sodium. Similarly, another study revealed that the Tramadol group do not have any statistically significant difference from the control group (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). These variations could be due to differences in the location of the included subjects or the manufacturers of the analgesics used.</p>
              <p>To ensure the standardization of the study and to eliminate confounders that would affect the outcome of the study, many parameters such i.e. inclusion and exclusion criteria were controlled; which resulted in causing a few limitations. For instance, the results may not be generalizable to individuals outside the age range of 18–65 years. Another evident limitation of the study was the provision of a single technique to achieve anaesthesia which may not reflect realistic clinical scenarios where supplemental anaesthesia is often necessary to eliminate pain effectively. However, administering anaesthesia through a single technique eliminated possible confounders and enabled accurate evaluation of preoperative analgesic efficacy. Although Tramadol is clinically effective, it has been associated with more adverse effects than NSAIDs, particularly nausea and vomiting, limiting its frequent use (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In contrast, NSAIDs have been reported to be less harmful and clinically more effective than opioids. The present study found that Piroxicam was clinically superior to Diclofenac sodium with fewer adverse effects (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The side effects of either of these NSAIDs were expected to be negligible due to a single preoperative dosage form. However, no adverse effects were reported by the patients, but these effects were considered a limitation of the study. Additionally, the small sample size limited our results' interpretation, which could be improved by increasing the sample size. The duration of the present study was adequate for the recruitment of the desired sample size. Further studies may examine other factors such as age, ethnicity, or weight that could affect the effectiveness of preoperative analgesics.</p>
              <p>The present study has several strengths that contribute to the rigor and reliability of its results. Firstly, ethical guidelines approved by the board were strictly adhered to, and the trial was registered for transparency and accountability. The study also followed the PRIRATE 2020 guidelines for accurate reporting (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, sample size calculation was performed to ensure adequate power for detecting a meaningful effect size. Other methodological features that enhance the study's robustness include a single operator performing the procedure, double-blinding of both patients and the operating dentist, randomization of patients, and the use of validated outcome measures such as the HP VAS to assess pain levels. Appropriate statistical analyses were also employed to ensure the validity of the results.</p>
              <p>The rigorous methodology employed in this study increases the credibility of its findings and contributes to the advancement of the field. Specifically, the results could help clinicians select the most effective preoperative analgesic for patients with SIP, leading to better pain management and increased patient satisfaction. Furthermore, the study's findings may contribute to improving the overall quality of care for patients undergoing root canal treatment.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>The present study demonstrated that Piroxicam (93.3%) was more clinically effective than Tramadol (83.3%) and Diclofenac sodium (60%) in achieving IANB in patients with SIP of the mandibular molars, although without any statistical significance (p=0.906). Therefore, while Piroxicam cannot be statistically considered superior to Tramadol or Diclofenac sodium, it may be preferred as a preoperative analgesic to enhance the efficacy of IANB in this patient population. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and evaluate the clinical applicability of Piroxicam as an analgesic adjunct to IANB in patients with SIP of the mandibular molars.</p>
