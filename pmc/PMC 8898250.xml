                  <p id="Par2">In this prospective clinical trial, we recruited 186 pregnant women, 17 of whom exhibited PD and delivered PLBW infants (PD-PLBW group). Of the remaining women, 155 presented PD and delivered healthy infants; 18 of these subjects with similar periodontal condition and age matched to the PD-PLBW group, and they became the PD-HD group. From the total group, 11 women exhibited healthy gingiva and had a healthy delivery (HD) and healthy infants (H-HD group), and 3 exhibited healthy gingiva and delivered PLBW infants (H-PLBW group). Periodontal parameters were recorded, and subgingival plaque and serum were collected during 26–28 gestational weeks. For the plaque samples, microbial abundance and diversity were accessed by 16S rRNA sequencing.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">The oral microbiome is a complex microbial community with up to 1,000 total microbial species, comprised of bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea, and protozoa that live in the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recent data point out the existence of specific microbial patterns that characterize the “healthy oral microbiota,” and these live in homeostasis with the host (eubiosis). However, changes in the oral cavity can alter the oral microbiome balance into a pathogenic state that can promote diseases in the host (dysbiosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current data support that a dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is correlated with the occurrence and progression of oral diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and systemic diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Over the past several decades, significant evidence has emerged that supports an association between periodontal pathogenic bacteria and preterm low birth weight (PLBW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Specifically, some anaerobic bacteria, such as <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Treponema denticola</italic>, have been described as keystone periodontal pathogens and have been used as diagnostic markers of periodontitis, as assessed by traditional culture and PCR methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clinical studies indicated that a higher detection frequency of periodontal related microbial species, such as <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>, and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic>, in saliva/dental plaque samples were related to PLBW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, bacterial DNA from <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> were frequently detected in feto-maternal units, such as placenta and amniotic fluid in mothers with full-term and PLBW neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Experimental animal studies showed that oral <italic>P. gingivali</italic>s infection induced preterm birth and low birth weight in pregnant mice. <italic>P. gingivali</italic>s was also observed in the placenta of the infection group by immunohistchemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">With the recent development of metagenomic sequencing technologies, a growing number of studies have revealed a greater degree of complexity in the oral microbiome than was previously appreciated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Previously, the vaginal microbiome was the most intensely studied area in attempts to find a microbial etiology for adverse pregnancy outcomes. In recent years, literature has expanded into other body sites, such as the placenta, oral cavity, and gut. As a result, evidence from these metagenomic sequencing studies have further characterized several bacterial communities and found that the placenta is most similar to the oral microbiome rather than the vaginal microbiome in terms of taxonomic composition. Moreover, a dysbiosis in the placental microbiome was related to preterm birth. To develop better prediction and intervention approaches for APO, it is critical to understand the oral microbiome changes during pregnancy and their association with APO. This clinical study found that the oral microbiome was relatively stable during pregnancy. However, several genera, such as <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, and <italic>Treponema</italic> were over-represented in the pregnant subjects, while <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> were more abundant in the non-pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The contribution of an oral microbiome dysbiosis to APO subjects especially preterm low birth weight has not been well explored.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Therefore, in this study, our objective was to determine the relationships between the oral subgingival microbiome, gingival/periodontal inflammation, and PLBW.</p>

                <p id="Par11">In this prospective study, a total of 186 subjects were recruited from the Department of Periodontology, West China Dental Hospital, Sichuan University, from May 2016 to May 2018 including patients and clinical staff.

Subgingival plaque and serum samples were collected during the periodontal examination visits. All subjects selected for the study had a minimum of 20 teeth and did not receive any periodontal or antibiotic treatment 3 months before the periodontal examinations. Subjects with any other systemic disease and/or multiple gestations were excluded from the study. Preterm birth (PB) was defined as a gestational age less than 37 weeks. Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as a birth weight of less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age based on Chinese standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

                <p id="Par13">All 186 women underwent a full-mouth periodontal examination during 26 to 28 weeks of gestation. Initially, an interview about confounding factors, such as oral hygiene behavior (the frequency of tooth brushing, duration of tooth brushing, utilization of special appliances, utilization of rinse), alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, education level, income level, and health insurance status, was obtained.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Periodontal examinations were then performed by a periodontal specialist with the use of a manual probe (Hu-Friedy, USA). Participants were instructed to abstain from eating and performing oral hygiene procedures for at least 2 h before plaque collection. During the examination, periodontal parameters, including periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and bleeding on probe (BOP), were recorded in six different sites for each tooth, including the mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, and disto-lingual sites.</p>

                <title>Criteria for periodontal disease (PD) diagnosis in a pregnancy population</title>
                <p id="Par15">Pregnancy seems to have a dramatic effect on the periodontium. Since the 1960s, it has been reported that there is increasing prevalence and severity of gingival inflammation in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Studies have shown that hormonal changes during pregnancy result in greater vascular permeability, gingival edema, crevicular fluid levels, and prostaglandin production, which may lead to increased gingival inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, even though the depth of periodontal pockets seems to increase during pregnancy, the actual PD activity level does not necessarily result in a decrease in the clinical attachment levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we used the PD criteria described by Lopez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Vogt et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in this study to operationally select pregnant women who positively and unequivocally exhibited PD—subjects who had gingival redness with 4 or more teeth exhibiting one or more sites of PPD≥4mm and/or BOP at &gt;25% of sites were diagnosed with PD.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Within the PD group, subjects who had CAL&gt;0 were diagnosed with periodontitis (P) and those with CAL=0 were diagnosed as gingivitis (G). Subjects who did not fulfill these criteria were diagnosed as clinically healthy (H).</p>

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity cutoff were clustered using the Mothur (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mothur.org">http://www.mothur.org</ext-link>). Chimeric sequences were identified and removed to reduce the effects of PCR artifacts, and each OTU representative sequence was classified taxonomically using RDP Classifier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rdp.cme.msu.edu">http://rdp.cme.msu.edu</ext-link>), using a confidence threshold of 0.7. Then, alpha diversity (Shannon, Simpson, Chao and Sobs) was obtained using Mothur (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mothur.org">http://www.mothur.org</ext-link>). Principal component analysis (PCA) using unweighted UniFrac distance metrics was carried out, and the R package was used to visualize interactions among bacterial communities in different samples.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The 16S rRNA gene sequencing from plaque samples produced more than 2 million raw sequences, and after pre-processing, 2020149 usable sequences with an average of 41,227 ± 8,808 sequences per sample remained in the dataset. The average length of the sequence was 441 bp without the primers, ranging from 388 to 426 bp. After removing the lower credibility OTUs, taxonomic assignment of the sequences resulted in the identification of a total of 1001 OTUs with more than 97% similarity in the subgingival microbiota. Our analysis showed that 99.0% of the oral microbiota sequenced aligned into 12 phyla. Additionally, 95.6% of the oral microbiota were clustered into 99 families and 91.0% aligned with 192 genera.</p>

                <p id="Par31">Also, no statistical differences were found in the Shannon and Simpson indices among the groups, indicating similar diversities among the H-HD, H-PLBW, PD-PLBW, and PD-HD groups. On the other hand, the Chao and Sobs indices demonstrated a slight but significant increase in diversity for PD-HD group compared to the H-PBLW group. This result may be due to the previously mentioned expansion of the <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> phyla for this sample compared to the other groups.</p>
                <p id="Par32">We next evaluated the beta diversity using principal component analysis (PCA) of the genus level data, and the results can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The analysis showed no obvious separation between the H, G, and P groups and between the H-HD, H-PLBW, PD-PLBW, and PD-HD groups, which corroborated the alpha diversity results, indicating similar microbial community structures for all groups. However, the H-HD group seemed to have a tight arrangement compared to the diseased groups and those with PBLW outcomes (i.e., PD-HD, H-PBLW, and PD-PBLW), which could indicate increased diversity in the diseased groups compared to H-HD group. Among the groups, the H-PLBW group seemed to be the most expanded, which agrees with the significantly higher diversity in the Chao and Sobs indices. Nonetheless, no significant difference was found among the groups.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity based on genera between the microbiota of the H, P, and G groups (<bold>a</bold>) and H-PLBW, H-HD, PD-PLBW, and PD-HD groups (<bold>b</bold>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par35">Intrauterine infection is the primary cause of APO. Evidence indicates two possible origins of intrauterine infections: ascending infection from the lower genital tract and hematogenous transmission from the oral microbiome. Although current paradigms suggest that most intrauterine infections originate in the lower genital tract and ascend into an otherwise “sterile” intrauterine environment, recent evidence showed that the placental microbiome was composed of nonpathogenic commensal microbiota from the <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Tenericutes</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, and <italic>Fusobacteria</italic> phyla. This profile is distinct from that of the vagina but similar to that of the oral microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">Findings from the last 2 decades supported a long-standing strong association between maternal periodontal disease and increased risk of pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. There are two possible pathogenic mechanisms that might explain the effect of periodontal inflammation on pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. First, periodontal pathogens originating in the gingival biofilm directly affect the feto-placental unit subsequent to bacteremia. Second, inflammatory mediators secreted by the subgingival inflammatory site are carried to the feto-placental unit, where they then cause an inflammatory response. So far, evidence indicates that periodontal pathogens, especially <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, are strongly associated with APO, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Clinical evidence shows that higher amounts of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> in subgingival plaque increase the risk of preterm birth, including our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Animal studies confirm that oral infection with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induce preterm birth and low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">An important key point of this study is that we were able to match the age and the periodontal status of 18 subjects, which would assist us in understanding how the oral microbiome might differently contribute to the birth results, without these other confounding variables.</p>
              <p id="Par38">A significant finding of this study is the possible correlation of the <italic>Neisseria</italic> genera and an unclassified <italic>Neisseria</italic> species in patients with gingival/periodontal inflammation and preterm low birth weight. We specifically found the genus to be negatively related with bleeding on probe (BOP) and positively related to birth weight, whereas the Neisseria genus and an unclassified <italic>Neisseria</italic> species were significantly lower in subjects with PLBW delivery. <italic>Neisseria</italic> is one of the most predominant genera among the <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, which itself is one of the four most abundant phyla colonizing the oral mucosa of humans along with <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par39">Several studies have evaluated the protective role of <italic>Neisseria</italic> species in oral diseases. Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Meuric et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] reported that the predominance of the genus <italic>Neisseria</italic> in oral microbiome indicates healthy periodontal conditions. A study in children between 3 and 18 years of age revealed that <italic>Neisseria</italic> is highly prevalent (97% of the total saliva samples) and <italic>Neisseria flavescens</italic> has been associated with a caries-free status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Zaura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] identified <italic>Neisseria</italic> as part of the healthy “core microbiome” of the human oral cavity. In contrast, Colombo et al. reported that <italic>Neisseria</italic> species were related to periodontal inflammation and tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">The <italic>Neisseria</italic> genera have also been studied in relation to systemic diseases. For instance, Said et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] reported a significant lower abundance of <italic>Neisseria</italic> and <italic>Gemella</italic> genera in the salivary microbiota of inflammatory bowel disease patients compared with healthy ones. Interestingly, Peters et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] reported that the commensal genus <italic>Neisseria</italic> and the <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> species were associated with lower esophageal cancer risk, whereas Farrell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reported that <italic>Neisseria elongata</italic>, along with <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, were significantly less abundant in pancreatic cancer patients compared to healthy patients. In contrast, the <italic>Neisseria</italic> genus was reported to be enriched in HIV+ subjects regardless of sampling site and PD level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which might indicate that some species in the genera may be opportunistic pathogens in humans. For instance, <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> is one of the most well studied pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> species. The species can colonize the oropharynx, causing an infection, but without symptoms. Yet, this infection can be transmitted during sexual activities to other sites of the body that are more typically associated with infectious complications, such as pelvic inflammation, epididymitis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Interestingly, the nonpathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensal bacteria can negatively affect <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> colonization by bacterial interspecies competition. Kim et al. reported that nonpathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> commensal bacteria, such as <italic>Neisseria elongata</italic> can inhibit <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> by a DNA uptake-dependent manner and pathogen clearance in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">However, the influence of <italic>Neisseria</italic> on pregnancy outcomes is still uncertain. Lin et al. reported an increased abundance of <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, and <italic>Treponema</italic> in the supra-gingival plaque samples of pregnant women, whereas <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> genera were more abundant in the non-pregnant group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Conversely, Paropkari et al. reported that pregnancy was associated with a significant decrease in species belonging to <italic>Neisseria</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> when compared to the non-pregnancy group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore this apparent discrepancy and to determine the impact of the <italic>Neisseria</italic> genus in pregnancy. Nonetheless, this study addresses the role of the nonpathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> species in adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Our data also supports that the intrinsic composition of bacterial taxa changes between pregnant women with or without gingival/periodontal inflammation and between women with healthy delivery and preterm low birth weight delivery. Prospective studies have shown that the level of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>T. denticola</italic>, <italic>P. intermedia</italic>, <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter rectus</italic>, <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, and <italic>Fretibacterium</italic> sp. HOT360 in the oral microbiome was positively correlated with gingival inflammation during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In this study, in terms of the composition of the oral microbiota, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were the five dominant phyla in the mouth. A higher abundance of <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and a lower abundance of <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were seen in groups with gingival/periodontal inflammation compared with gingival/periodontal healthy groups. Nonetheless, at the genus level, <italic>Treponema</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, <italic>Fretibacterium</italic>, <italic>Filifactor</italic>, and <italic>Peptostreptococcaceae</italic> were associated with gingival/periodontal inflammation. Periodontal therapy, including non-surgical periodontal therapy or probiotics may be warranted before or during pregnancy to reduce periodontal inflammation and correct the maternal oral microbiome dysbiosis.</p>
              <p id="Par43">We found no significant changes in microbiome diversity between the four groups, which is in agreement with the literature. For instance, Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] indicate that the oral microbiome diversity was stable during pregnancy and gingival inflammation and birth outcomes might not be related to overall microbial community structures shifts. Also, we found no significant changes between P and G group, a possible reason might be related to the subjects’ age. All subjects were pregnant women in their 20s to 30s with minimal CAL.</p>
              <p id="Par44">This study has some limitations. One of the limitations of this study was the small sample size, especially in the H-PLBW group. This study was performed at a single institution, which prevented us from having a larger sample size. The oral microbiome during pregnancy appears to be complex, and this fact by itself warrants further large-scale longitudinal studies to understand the role of oral bacteria in PLBW outcomes. Additionally, single-variate statistical analyses were used in this study, which could have limited the overall results of the study.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par45">In this study, we found a lower abundance of the <italic>Neisseria</italic> genus and of an unclassified <italic>Neisseria</italic> species in women who had preterm low birth weight deliveries. Moreover, our analysis demonstrated that <italic>Neisseria</italic> genera were positively correlated to birth weight in these women. Therefore, correcting oral microbiome dysbiosis, such as improving <italic>Neisseria</italic> genera abundance before or during pregnancy by periodontal therapy, may be useful in preventing PLBW deliveries. Thus, the oral commensal <italic>Neisseria</italic> may have a clinical potential for predicting PLBW.</p>
