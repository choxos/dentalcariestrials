                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Immigrants are known to experience greater socioeconomic stress and poorer well-being and to suffer more from lifestyle- and diet-related disorders than native populations. There is also evidence that children of immigrant parents are at greater risk of diverse health problems than their host country cohorts. The aim of this study is to apply and evaluate the efficacy of an early life intervention program among parents/children with immigrant background to prevent childhood caries and obesity, thereby improving the children’s general health, oral health, and quality of life.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled intervention follow-up study. In phase I of the study, the primary care health centers in the municipality of Bergen, Norway were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. The intervention was carried out using the motivational interviewing technique and the common risk factor approach. The intervention group received guidance on diet/oral hygiene and the control group received standard care information. Parental knowledge and children at age 3 and 5 years old will be assessed in a prospective phase II follow-up study compared to native Norwegian controls. The primary outcome will be evaluation of change on parental oral health related knowledge and attitudes. The secondary outcome will assess the impact of the intervention on children’s caries -, body mass index- and oral health related quality of life.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">According to Statistics Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], immigrants comprise nearly 20% of the population. They represent health-, societal- and economic assets, but also face challenges which the Norwegian society might help to address, facilitating their adaptation and integration to the new culture. A Norwegian of immigrant background is a person born in Norway, with one or two immigrant parents. Immigrants tend to find their changed living conditions disorienting, making it difficult for them to participate fully in the new society. For many reasons, a move to an unfamiliar environment may be difficult, not least due to lack of proficiency in the language of the new country. Several studies confirm that compared to the native population, the well-being of immigrants in Norway is poorer and they suffer more from lifestyle and diet-related disorders such as obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Food security describes a situation in which there is physical, social, and economic access to safe, nutritious food, in quantities which meet the dietary needs and food preferences required to ensure an active and healthy life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Food insecurity is reported to affect the well-being of children and adults of immigrant families in many Western countries, including the United States and United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For most migrants, both the number of calories and the content of the diet change as a result of diverse factors, including language difficulties, lack of acculturation, shortages of previously used products, and culturally related factors associated with food. These factors underlying dietary changes may all contribute to different diseases, including a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease as well as dental caries. Kumar and co-authors reported a high prevalence of obesity and overweight among immigrants from Pakistan and Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Studies primarily from the United States and United Kingdom have consistently shown that upon arrival, immigrants have lower BMI than their host-country-born counterparts. After longer residence, however, there is a change to higher BMI, overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Compared with ethnic majority children in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, non-western (NW) immigrant children show overall poorer health outcomes with respect to diabetes, obesity, oral health, mental health, and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent review of meta-analyses of data from studies conducted in developed and developing countries revealed that overweight and obese children had significantly more dental caries than children of normal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the sample population, both conditions were found to be associated with low levels of parental income and education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some immigrant groups who transition from a fiber-rich, whole grain diet to a high-fat diet with lower vegetable intake might be at increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A previous report has revealed that specific dietary habits (frequent intake of sugar and sweetened drinks) were considered to be common risk factors for both childhood obesity and caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">In addition to dietary habits which constitute risk factors common to obesity and dental caries, other habits uniquely associated with heightened caries risk are common among immigrants. In some immigrant communities toothbrushing, oral hygiene routines and preventive dental care are less common and not regarded as important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many families seek dental care only when a child is in pain or there is visible decay and preserving baby teeth may not be prioritized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A Norwegian cohort study identified the following significant caries risk indicators among children at age 5 years: a mother consuming a diet very high in fat or sugar, a mother with low education and one or both parents of NW immigrant background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Early childhood caries (ECC) is defined as any form of caries (cavitated or non-cavitated) occurring in the primary dentition of children aged 6 years or younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In children aged between 2.5 and 3.5 years, a combination of different factors constitutes predictors for developing caries, including the mother’s education, immigrant background, and consumption of candy and sugar-containing beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">In high-income countries there has been a marked decline in the incidence and prevalence of ECC over recent decades, reducing the psychosocial and economic burden of this disease for individuals and for society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, ECC remains an important health issue in particular population subgroups and in many countries, including Norway, immigrant children are found to be at high risk. Previous studies have revealed that children of NW immigrant backgrounds have higher caries experience than their native counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is attributed to lack of parental knowledge, poor communication due to language barriers and ethnic and cultural differences.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Children with ECC may experience pain when drinking hot or cold liquids, difficulty chewing and biting, poor appetite, weight loss, disturbed sleep, behavioral changes such as irritability and low self-esteem and a decline in academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that ECC has a negative effect on the quality of life (QoL) of preschool children and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Further research is needed to determine whether and if so, to what extent, the quality of life of immigrant families living in Norway is affected by their children’s EEC.</p>
              <p id="Par11">Globally, obesity and dental caries constitute increasing public health problems. Both conditions are multifactorial, chronic, and highly prevalent, with significant and potentially lifelong impacts on health and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The two conditions are thought to share common contributing factors, including biological, genetic, socioeconomic, cultural, environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The dietary factors include poor food choices, unhealthy dietary habits, frequent and high consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, consumption of sweetened foods/drinks, and high-calorie/cariogenic diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a previous study, obesity, socio-economic factors, infrequent toothbrushing habits, and consumption of cariogenic beverages were identified as significant caries risk factors. It is of interest to note that a weak association was found between caries and extreme obesity (or morbid obesity) in children aged 4–17 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Though no evidence emerged of an association between obesity and caries among 6-year-old British children living in Plymouth, the deprivation highlights the vulnerability of children living in disadvantaged families to have both excess weight and more carious lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].With caries and obesity acknowledged as the two most prevalent diseases of childhood, additional research should focus on the benefits and feasibility of widespread interdisciplinary medical-oral health collaboration in addressing and modifying common risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There are few culturally tailored health interventions. The fact that there are risk factors common to several systemic and oral health conditions, would support an approach in which oral health is integrated into primary health care services.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Reduction of free sugars in the diet can be part of a strategy to reduce risk factors common to both dental caries and childhood obesity. Thus, information about family standards, parental attitudes, and dietary habits of parents of NW immigrant backgrounds might provide a valuable tool for planning, implementation, and evaluation of culturally adapted health promotion programs. Intervention programs, focusing on dietary- and oral hygiene practices among NW immigrant families attending primary health care centers and based on a Common Risk Factor Approach (CRFA) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) might successfully reduce the incidence of caries and obesity. Such a program could be implemented within a community-based healthcare system throughout the country. Potentially, the trial results might be extrapolated to fill a knowledge gap about immigrant parents in Norway.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Several approaches for intervention have been applied to establish a model for child oral health promotion and to reduce inequalities in oral health. In a study carried out in Melbourne, families of Iraqi, Lebanese, or Pakistani backgrounds, with children aged 1–4 years, were invited to participate in an intervention project including community oral health education sessions and reorienting of dental health and family services. According to the authors, the findings from this study contribute to the limited evidence base in support of community interventions to improve child oral health in migrant communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In a recent study among Indian children aged 10–12 years, it was shown that an intervention in the form of oral health education (delivered through lectures and demonstrations by an undergraduate dental student) and topical antibacterial therapy (fluoride varnish and povidone-iodine) resulted in an improvement in caries and periodontal scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is claimed that in indigenous communities in Alaska, community-centered multilevel interventions (educating families and communities and training mid-level dental care providers) will improve oral and systemic health and reduce pediatric tooth decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par23">This is a cluster randomized controlled intervention follow-up study. By integrating primary health care and the public dental health service, the basis of the study is the application of an early-life intervention program among parents/children of immigrant backgrounds, using the MI technique and CRFA to prevent dental caries and obesity, thereby improving their general health, oral health, and quality of life. Primary care health centers in the municipality of Bergen, Norway, were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups (allocation ratio 1:1), to evaluate the efficacy of the culturally adapted dietary/hygiene advice. The intervention group received guidance on diet/hygiene and the control group received standard care, including regular health information at the primary care health centers. The study has been funded by the Norwegian Research Council for three years.</p>

                  <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                  <p id="Par49">Different theoretical approaches are used in this project, including:</p>
                  <p id="Par50"><underline>MI:</underline> defined as “a person-centered counseling style for addressing the common problem of uncertainty about change”. A recent systematic review identified MI as being the most effective approach for altering health behavior in an individual oral health promotion setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, it is strategic to use culturally adapted MI to convey actionable information and motivate health-related behavioral change in families with newborn children.</p>
                  <p id="Par51"><underline>CRFA:</underline> This approach addresses risk factors common to many chronic conditions within the context of the broader socio-environmental setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The main implication of CRFA for oral health policies is collaboration with other sectors and disciplines. Oral health issues need to be integrated into primary health care, with recommendations which promote general health. As some chronic diseases share common causes, adopting a collaborative CRFA is more rational than focusing on one disease.</p>
                  <p id="Par52"><underline>TPB:</underline> is a commonly utilized social cognitive theory, predicting behavioral intention and behavior. TPB incorporates three main constructs that influence behavioral intention, including attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The TPB has successfully accounted for a high proportion of variance in several health-related behaviors including those related to oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In this project, we will use the TPB to explain dietary behavior intentions of parents with NW immigrant background and identify the most important causal factors. Dietary intention is predicted by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. According to the TPB, the effectiveness of educational strategies depends on successfully changing the most important attitudinal components of TPB. The relative weight of the predictors of behavioral intention determines whether the main focus should be on attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavioral control.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par55">Parents of immigrant background are not able to derive much benefit from the health information currently provided at healthcare centers. This is attributed to low attendance rates, poor skills in the host language and illiteracy in terms of beliefs and behaviors which differ from those of the host population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A previous Norwegian study suggests that immigrant groups in Western societies require different information packages, modified strategies, and encouragement to exercise discipline with reference to factors which have deleterious effects on general and oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, this work indicated that NW immigrant families with small children might be in great need of an early, culturally adapted intervention in the form of healthy dietary advice/guidance and early oral health care. Currently there is scarce evidence to support the efficacy of culturally tailored health interventions (interventions which take culture-specific factors into account).</p>

                <title>Need for intervention</title>
                <p id="Par56">Why use MI and CRFA in the present innovative intervention?</p>
                <p>To reduce common dietary-related behavior, which contributes to the risk of obesity and dental caries in children, parents need to be educated about the sugar content of processed foods and beverages as well as the negative impact on their children’s health of frequent daily sugar consumption. Moreover, health professionals must engage in identifying children who are at risk for obesity and dental caries and provide education, screening, and referral to reduce common risk behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, by engaging primary healthcare professionals, this project might contribute to solutions for different challenges, including communication when encountering parents of immigrant background seeking health and welfare services. By creating a collaborative model between primary care and dental health services, the project prioritizes services which are sustainable and cost-effective for society, resulting in user satisfaction.</p>
                <p>This outcome has been documented in previous reports. In an Australian study, families of Iraqi, Lebanese, or Pakistani background were offered community oral health education sessions and reorienting of dental health and family services, with promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Ninty three percent of caregivers of children aged 6–36 months reported positive behavioral changes after an intervention to improve feeding practices. The authors of this study stated that partnerships between dental and nutrition professionals offer opportunities to address key dietary behaviors that may prevent obesity and improve oral health, particularly among children at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While intervention studies focusing on diet-related diseases in young children have reported various outcomes, MI has proved to be the most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
                <p>The main strength of this study is that it is a randomized trial, making it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program to prevent caries and obesity. The use of cluster randomization allows the identification of the intervention effects when randomization at individual level is not appropriate. Cluster randomization may help to prevent contamination caused by sharing of information between intervention and control participants. Using a culturally adapted health intervention program, focusing on dietary- and oral hygiene practices among NW immigrant families attending primary health care centers might positively impact parental attitudes towards the oral health of their children. In this study, the collaboration between dental public health and primary health care personnel using the CRFA and MI is an innovation which offers opportunities to address key dietary behaviors that may improve general and oral health, particularly among at-risk children.</p>
                <p>A possible limitation of this study is that data will be collected by means of a self-reported questionnaire, in which participants might be inclined to give more socially acceptable answers. The diverse backgrounds and different periods of residence in Norway might influence comparisons between groups as well as the acculturation effects. Finally, the two sessions for data collection limit the potential to draw causal inferences about the influence of parental characteristics on their hygiene/feeding practice knowledge and attitudes.</p>

                <title>Dissemination, sharing and utilization</title>
                <p id="Par61">We intend to disseminate the findings to the professionals most closely involved (e.g., dentists, primary care health personnel, etc.) and to extend this information to other communities in order to increase general awareness of the health care needs of immigrants and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between oral and primary health care authorities. To improve health awareness among immigrants, educational seminars targeting newly arrived immigrants will be arranged at local health service centers, including public primary health care centers, dental public health service centers and health information days arranged by dental students. In this context the informative intervention materials produced for the present study will be of help to the primary health care medical staff to improve communication challenges with NW immigrant parents.</p>
