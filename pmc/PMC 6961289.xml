                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Despite great improvement in child oral health, some children subgroups still suffer from higher levels of dental caries. Geographic and socioeconomic barriers and the lack of access to dental care services are among common reasons for poor oral health in children. Historically in Australia, oral health therapists or dental therapists have been responsible for providing dental care for school children through the School Dental Services (SDS). The current SDS has been unable to provide sustainable dental care to all school children due to a reduction in workforce participation and limited resources. We propose a paradigm shift in the current service through the introduction of user-friendly technology to provide a foundation for sustainable dental care for school children.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We describe an ongoing parallel, two-armed, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial that compares routine and teledental pathway of dental care in children aged 4–15 years (<italic>n</italic> = 250). Participating schools in Western Australia will be randomly assigned to the control or teledental group, approximately three schools in each group with a maximum of 45 children in each school. All participants will first receive a standard dental examination to identify those who require urgent referrals and then their teeth will be photographed using a smartphone camera. At the baseline, children in the control group will receive screening results and advice on the pathway of dental care based on the visual dental screening while children in the teledental group will receive screening results based on the assessment of dental images. At 9 months follow-up, all participants will undergo a final visual dental screening. The primary outcomes include decay experience and proportion of children become caries active. The secondary outcomes include the diagnostic performance of photographic dental assessment and costs comparison of two pathways of dental care.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The current project seeks to take advantage of mobile technology to acquire dental images from a child’s mouth at school settings and forwarding images electronically to an offsite dental practitioner to assess and prepare dental recommendations remotely. Such an approach will help to prioritise high-risk children and provide them with a quick treatment pathway and avoid unnecessary referrals or travel.</p>

              <p id="Par15">Dental caries (tooth decay) remains the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood, even ahead of asthma and hay fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to the Child Dental Health Survey 2010, the proportion of Australian children with caries experience (decayed, missing and filled teeth ‘dmft + DMFT’ &gt; 0) varied from 48% for children aged 5 years to 69% for children aged 9 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is a significant social gradient between socioeconomic status and the prevalence and severity of oral diseases which highlights oral health inequalities and inadequate funding for prevention and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dental caries is an entirely preventable dynamic disease, with an interplay of risk factors that protect against or cause progression of the disease. In general diet, oral hygiene and fluoride exposure are the most common factors assessed when determining an individual’s risk level for the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">If dental caries remains untreated, it can have serious consequences that require costly treatment. Dental caries can lead to physical and psychosocial consequences including pain, sepsis, and disturbed eating, drinking and sleep pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Poor oral health can have a significant impact on a child’s development including below average height, weight, and head circumference, and absenteeism from school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The demand for dental care is increasing and with it the total costs. Recurrent expenditure on dental care services in Australia increased from $6.6 billion AUD in 2006–07 to $10.2 billion AUD in 2016–17 (adjusted for inflation), at an average annual growth rate of 4.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Dental extractions and restorations are the most common reported causes for hospital admission among Australian children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For instance, between 2000 and 2009, a total of 43,937 children (0–14 years) were hospitalised due to various oral conditions in Western Australia (WA) with total costs of $92 million AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Dental therapists or more recently oral health therapists (OHTs) have been responsible for providing most of the dental services (including examinations, fillings, extractions and preventive care) for school children ages 5–14 years through the government-funded school dental services (SDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The history of SDS in Australia can be traced back to the 1920s, where it was designed to provide dental care for poor and disadvantaged children. Following the introduction of the Australian School Dental Scheme (ASDS) in 1973 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the SDS has expanded to cover all primary schools in all states and territories. Similar services are provided in several countries such as New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite improvements in child oral health, nearly half the school children receiving dental care within the SDS do not enjoy good oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In recent years, the SDS has suffered a reduction in workforce participation, scarcity of resources, and services remain largely concentrated in the metropolitan regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Until the 2000s, the employment of dental therapists was limited to the state-operated SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, many dental therapists have opted for private practice career or even leaving the profession which resulted in decreased retention and recruitment of dental therapists or OHTs in the SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the current SDS rarely provides sustainable dental care and is unable to meet all child oral health needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Children are at high risk of developing dental caries, but its impact can be reduced or prevented through early detection, early intervention, including caries risk assessment and tailored oral hygiene interventions and the provision of preventive dental care, particularly, in the early life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to regularly monitor the oral health of high-risk children to address the risk factors which can reduce the overall burden of the disease in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, reaching out to all school children, particularly, in rural regions, is challenging and costly. Thus, there is a need for an equitable and cost-efficient model of dental care to enhance the opportunity to provide sustainable dental care for school children, particularly those living in remote regions.</p>
              <p id="Par19">One of the potentially viable alternatives to address child oral health inequities and inequalities is the use of telehealth. Teledentistry is a form of telehealth that is specifically dedicated to dentistry and uses electronic medical records, information and communication technology (ICT), digital photography and the Internet for consultation, supervision or continuing education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Telehealth, particularly, mobile technology, is an attractive innovation due to mobile connectivity, improving digital photography capabilities and the computational power of smartphones which allow their users to perform multiple tasks such as data processing, storage and transfer as well as access to low-cost, secure cloud storage. The use of a smartphone camera in dental photography can be useful for recording a baseline of oral health status pre-operatively, which can be used to confirm the diagnosis and preparing an appropriate treatment plan. As smartphones are widely carried and can be used at any time, they can be used as point-of-care devices to improve the delivery of patient-centred care. A telehealth model of care delivery suits role substitution in dentistry, particularly, facilitating data collection, health promotion and screening. At the screening level, trained teachers or school staff, using a user-friendly mobile technology, can help in collecting digital data from school children for later evaluation by a dental expert from a distance. Ample evidence indicated that the involvement of trained non-dental health personnel in the screening and provision of oral health promotion has been beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The use of telehealth can be ideal for the rural population who have no or limited access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">The proposed project builds on previous validation trials that examined the feasibility of the teledentistry approach to dental screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The findings showed that the use of dental photography in dental screening is feasible and offered a moderate diagnostic accuracy relative to visual dental screening. Recent systematic reviews indicated that most reviewed studies concerned with teledental diagnosis demonstrated comparable results between photographic and visual inspection techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although telehealth applications are becoming increasingly popular in dentistry, controlled assessments of clinical outcomes, long-term use and economic analyses of teledentistry are still limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A comparison of the costs of teledentistry and its alternatives is of great importance to those making future decisions about implementing a new service. In this study, we propose a paradigm shift in the existing dental services through role substitution and taking advantage of user-friendly mobile technology and the widely available Internet to improve school children access to dental services.</p>

                <p id="Par27">Software engineers from the CSIRO’s Australian e-Health Research Centre (AEHRC), developed a reliable electronic health record system ‘Remote-I’ based on store-and-forward technology. There are two components of the prototype of the existing teledentistry system, (1) an image acquisition mobile App ‘Teledental’ to facilitate entry of patient information and capturing dental images, and then transferring the data to a secure drive using Wi-Fi or 4G network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Capturing and reviewing images and lighting functions will be integrated into a single mobile App installed on a smartphone; and (2) web-based platform application ‘Remote-I’ for storage, viewing and charting of dental photographs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The Remote-I system has been used in tele-retinal screening for diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and it was recently modified so it can be employed for dental screening purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More information about the Remote-I and image acquisition mobile App are described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

The schools will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the teledental or control group. For allocation of the participants, a computer-generated list of random numbers will be used. To approximate equality of sample sizes in the study groups, we will use block randomisation with computer-generated randomly permuted blocks of 4 at each school. School-specific randomisation lists are concealed by an independent researcher, and kept in sequence and opened as participants are examined at the baseline and found eligible for enrolment. The research team and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation and will not be aware of the randomisation procedure. Study participants (and their parents/guardians) and OHTs providing the intervention and/or collecting data cannot be blinded to group allocation.

The OHP leaflets are readily available on the Dental Health Services WA website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dental.wa.gov.au/">https://www.dental.wa.gov.au/</ext-link>) and permission has been obtained to use these leaflets.</p>

Findings from the visual dental assessment will be recorded on an oral health assessment form that follows the guidelines for oral health surveys developed by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Following the completion of the baseline dental screening, parents of school children allocated to the control group will receive a copy of the screening results based on the visual inspection performed by onsite OHTs.

The tele-assistants will be provided with a dental photography protocol and will receive hands-on training on how to use the image acquisition App and capture good images. Disposable cheek retractors will be used to assist in viewing teeth during dental photography. Using the mobile App, the tele-assistants will first create a basic registration (includes a unique ID, age in years, gender and school name) for each participant. Then a minimum of five still dental images per child will be taken (front, right lateral, left lateral, upper occlusal, and lower occlusal views). Following the completion of dental photography and creating a record on the App, each participant’s set of data (including dental images and anonymous patient details) will be then directly uploaded from the mobile App to a secure drive located at the CSIRO, for later evaluation by charters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The assessment of dental images will be performed independently by 2–4 registered OHTs (charters). Charters will receive instructions on how to log in and use the web-based application (Remote-I), review images and insert findings back to the system. After selecting a record from the database, a list of dental images and a predefined assessment chart appears for the charter to insert their findings. The chart includes a digital oral health assessment form, which aligns with the WHO protocol for oral health assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The system enables charters to independently review dental images and submit reports or treatment plans to the Remote-I system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The assessment of dental caries will be completed at the tooth level rather than the tooth surface, based on a protocol developed by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

The study addresses priorities raised in the National Oral Health Plan 2015–2024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. More specifically, it identifies vulnerable and rural people as a priority area warranting actions to reduce inequity in dental care access.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Healthy behaviours and practices established in the early life of the child are often carried into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, improving oral health in childhood is fundamental for reducing dental caries, early tooth loss and other oral diseases in adulthood and the advanced aged period. However, improving the population’s oral health is challenging, with an unequal distribution of the dental workforce and scarcity of resources making the transition to the prevention of dental diseases difficult. Many children, particularly those from advantaged backgrounds who attend for a routine check-up, are free of dental diseases and consuming most scarce resources. However, this is not the case for socially disadvantaged children who tend to have higher rates of dental diseases and much of it goes untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Paradigm shifts in the current SDS whereby trained non-dental personnel, embracing a user-friendly mobile App, can work on the frontline to aid in identifying high-risk children. The front-line clinicians can collect oral health data (e.g. demographic information and still/live images) from screen-positive patients using their mobile devices and then store-and-forward the records to a dental expert at a distance to confirm the diagnosis or to request further investigation. Children who screened positive can then have a quick pathway to receive appropriate treatment while those who are at low-risk or caries-free will receive preventive care. This is important, as this could alleviate the anxiety of patients and if necessary, initiate earlier intervention. Also, this strategy could help direct specific dental care towards children that need it more and contributing to reducing inequalities in child oral health.</p>
              <p id="Par48">The expected benefits from the interventions are an improvement in the oral health status of school children, with a reduction in decay experience, disease prevention, and cost-saving due to a reduction of inappropriate referrals and unnecessary travel. Also, dental photography can be used to create digital dental archives which will help in assessing the progress of dental diseases and wide-reaching research opportunities. This study will provide an evidence-based framework for other research groups to carry out interventional RCTs to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telehealth in improving care delivery and oral health in school children.</p>
