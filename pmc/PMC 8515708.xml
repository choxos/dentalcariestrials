                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A randomized controlled trial was conducted with parallel study groups, comprising 12–15-year-old school children, 120 in each group. OHE was given to the experimental group at baseline, third and sixth months and to the control group after completion of the study. Interview of the participants were done using a 23-item questionnaire for assessment of oral hygiene KAP. For each question, correct answer was scored as 1 and wrong answer was scored zero. An overall composite score was then created, by adding the individual scores. Oral examination was done using mouth mirror and WHO probe to record Turesky–Gilmore–Glickman modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index, Gingival index and Dentition status and treatment needs. Analysis was done using chi-square test for categorical data and independent t test, Mann–Whitney U test, repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey’s test for quantitative data. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par21">The worldwide prevalence of dental disease is a constant reminder of the universal need for effective dental health education programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. World Health Organization (WHO) reports 70–95% of school-aged children have experienced dental caries in South-East Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Health education is a key strategy in the process of acquisition of behaviors that promote and maintain health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mastrantonio and Garcia point out that it is possible to transform negative attitudes into healthy habits to the population through education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Oral health is indispensable to general health and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Oral health is multifaceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow, and convey a range of emotions through facial expressions with confidence and without pain, discomfort, and disease of the craniofacial complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Few aspects of health which are accessible to personal control such as oral hygiene, can be improved by simple behavioral changes. The objective of Oral health education (OHE) program is to improve the knowledge and oral hygiene status of the participants which would have obvious merits. As a result of OHE, there has been improvement of self-reported oral health related practices and behavior as well as clinical parameters of oral health such as oral hygiene, gingival health and dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Many of the oral diseases in the advanced stages lead to pain, discomfort and handicap. In a cross-sectional survey of 106 schools in different parts of Nepal, 45% of 4770 school children from age 8 to 14 years experienced toothache. Major impact included inability to eat (61%) loss of sleep (14%), financial burden (7%), inability to play (6%), missed school (5%), inability to do homework (2%) and all the above (6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">About 37 percent of the total population of Nepal is in between 5 to 14 years, and out of them nearly 92% children are enrolled in school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].The 2004 National Pathfinder Survey of Nepal showed that 41% of 12–13 years old schoolchildren suffer from dental caries with mean DMFT of 1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Prevalence of dental caries among public school children in eastern Nepal is 60.30% in primary dentition and 55.6% in permanent dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A study in eastern Nepal found fair plaque control in 62.3% and poor plaque control in 37.7% in 10–13 years school children. It concluded that a community based oral health intervention program was necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Oral health education and promotion can be delivered at different forums like hospitals, primary health care centers, private dental clinics, school, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, schools are perhaps the best place for promoting oral health because schools form an ideal setting by offering an efficient and effective way to reach over 1 billion children worldwide and through them, their families as well as communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. School based approach seems to be more productive in delivering preventive and curative services as compared to community-based approach. Children who are suffering from poor oral health are 12 times most likely to have restricted daily activities including missing schools as compared to those who have good oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Due to this more than 50 million school hours are lost annually which could lead to negative impact on the long-term performances of children at school and success in future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">In recent years, attention has been drawn toward assessing the effectiveness of oral health education programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This is in line with demand for evidence-based research and will help to inform policy makers on how to allocate resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A number of systematic reviews have been conducted on the available evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These have shown that oral health education can be effective in increasing knowledge in the short term and to some extent, behavior such as tooth brushing and healthy eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]<bold>.</bold></p>
              <p id="Par27">To the best of our knowledge no such educational intervention studies have been published till now in Nepal. In a country like Nepal where majority of people who don’t have awareness and accessibility to oral-dental care, there is strong and urgent need for oral health education intervention which will help to reduce mortality and morbidity. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an oral health education intervention on oral hygiene knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP), plaque control and gingival health among 12–15 years old school children in Dharan sub-metropolitan city, Nepal.</p>

In concurrent parallel trial comparisons are made between two randomly assigned groups with one group exposed to intervention. Children belonging to 12–15-year-old age group studying in grade 8 and 9 in public and private schools of Dharan sub-metropolitan city, Nepal were included in the study.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Dharan is a sub-metropolitan city in Sunsari district of province No.1, Nepal. The total area of the sub-metropolitan is 192.32 square kilometers. According to 2011 Census conducted by Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City had total population of 137,705 with 64,671 males and 73,034 females. There were only 106,424 people fully literate as of 2011 who were able to both read and write, while 2349 people were able to read but not write. According to Nepal Government records as of 2017, there were total 6,515 school children studying in grade 1 to 12 in Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City with 3128 (48.01%) of males and 3387 (51.99%) females. The shortest distance from capital city (Kathmandu) of Nepal to Dharan through road is 379 km which takes around 8 h and 35 min.</p>

Face and content validity of the structured questionnaire was done by three subject experts. A 23-item questionnaire was translated and validated in Nepali language (local language) through standard back translation method. Test–retest was used to check the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire. Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.81 showed good internal consistency of the questionnaire.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Each of the 23 multiple choice questions had a single correct answer. All questions had a binary outcome which was coded as one for correct and zero for incorrect. Every correct answer in baseline, 3 and 6 months after intervention was scored as 1 and wrong answers were scored zero. An overall composite score was then created, by adding the individual scores on each question. The highest possible score for oral health knowledge was 11 for each individual. The highest possible score for oral health practices and attitude were 8 and 4 respectively. The highest possible overall score for oral hygiene KAP was 23. The mean score was then calculated for each group and then compared. The percentage change was calculated by subtracting the pre-test percentage from the post-test percentage [100 × (baseline mean score-6 months score)/baseline score].</p>
                <p id="Par39">Face to face interview of the participants were done by the single investigator (KS). Time taken for each interview was 4–5 min. Demographic variables included age, sex, grade, type of school (public or private) and socioeconomic status (SES). SES was calculated using Kuppuswamy scale and classified as per the modifications done in the year 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] using current consumer price index for the year 2017. The current consumer price index was obtained online from Nepal Rastra Bank website (Nepal RB 2017) and the conversion factor was calculated (Conversion factor = consumer price index 2017 divided by consumer price index of 1976) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The computed conversion factor was 26.7 (114.8/4.3). For simplicity, SES was categorized into upper (26–29), middle (11–25) and lower (≤ 10) class.</p>

              <p id="Par60">The results of the present study showed that OHE seems to be effective in increasing oral hygiene KAP and improving plaque control and gingival health.</p>
              <p id="Par61">In the present study 12–15-year-old school children were taken as study population because it is likely that by this age all the permanent teeth except the third molars will have erupted. Therefore, age 12 years has been a global indicator for comparisons and surveillance of disease trends at international level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Proper use of a toothbrush requires a certain degree of dexterity and skill. Nonetheless, children as young as 11 years of age have the ability to brush effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It was expected that at this age student can clearly understand the subject being taught to them. They have enough manual dexterity to master the proper technique of brushing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They are in the very influential stages of life; the habits, beliefs, skills and attitudes that have developed would tend to last longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A study conducted by Ingle et al. found that eight years old children are not appropriate group to start with oral health education intervention as they could not follow the oral hygiene instructions properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par62">The results showed that oral hygiene knowledge was significantly increased by 77.51% in experimental group and 6.6% in control group when compared to baseline. It was almost similar to the study done by Rajesh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] where oral hygiene knowledge was increased by 57.25% versus 0.80% in computer method of oral education vs control group at 3 months. In Walsh study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] dental health knowledge was increased by 44.80% versus 5.49% in experimental and control group. A study conducted by Haque et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that oral health knowledge was significantly increased from 19.3% (baseline) to 75.9% at 6 months after intervention. Similarly, the oral health knowledge was increased after intervention in experimental group in the studies conducted by Al Saffan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and D'Cruz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Oral hygiene attitude and practices was significantly improved by 35.5% and 31.87% respectively in experimental group whereas it was decreased by 4.94% and 7.82% in control group. The findings of this study were in accordance with the study conducted by Haque et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] where oral health attitude and practices was significantly increased by 43.1% and 36.2% respectively in the intervention group after 6 months. Similarly, the oral health attitude and practices were significantly increased in the study conducted by Sanadhya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] after intervention. The overall oral hygiene knowledge, attitude and practices was significantly increased by 54.58% in experimental group and almost no change in control group.</p>
              <p id="Par63">There was significant reduction in mean plaque index scores (57.67%) in experimental group whereas only 4.56% reduction in control group. These findings were found to be in accordance with the studies done by Shahapur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Lakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], Worthington et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Gauba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], Redmond et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] where significant reduction in mean plaque levels was reported after intervention. In contrast to this study Frencken et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Palenstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] found no significant reduction in plaque scores after intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par64">Ganesh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] reported significant reduction of 17.5% mean plaque level and 27.8% mean GI after 4 weeks of intervention. In a study by Bhardwaj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] mean plaque and gingival score decreased significantly after intervention irrespective of gender in 12- and 15-years old school children. Damle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] reported that mean PI and GI was significantly improved after 3 months intervention in 12–15-year-old school children.</p>
              <p id="Par65">There was significant reduction in mean gingival index (40.90%) in experimental group whereas almost no changes (0.7% reduction) in control group after 6 months of oral health education. These findings were found to be in accordance with the studies done by De Farias et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Gauba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and Sharma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] where significant reduction in mean GI score was reported after intervention. In contrast to this study Ajithkrishnan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] found no significant reduction in gingival scores after intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par66">The present study did not show any significant changes in mean DMFT in between and among the groups. The percentage increase in mean DMFT was higher in control group (142.39%) as compared to experimental group (98.71%). It was similar to study conducted by Vanobbergen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] where mean DMFT was found to be higher in the control group but not significantly different. A study conducted by Frencken et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] reported that mean caries increment in experimental (0.04) and control group (0.19) was not found to be statistically significant over a period of 3.5 years. Sharma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Palenstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] also reported similar findings. In contrast to this study Hausen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] found mean DMFS increments were significantly lower for experimental group than control group after average follow up of 3.4 years. Reason for this difference may be due to longer duration of their study and provision of patient-centered regimen for caries control.</p>
              <p id="Par67">Improvement in oral hygiene knowledge and plaque score was seen in control group. This may have occurred as a result of Hawthorne effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Hawthorne effect is a form of reactivity whereby subjects improve an aspect of their behavior being studied, and not in response to any particular experimental manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These changes may have occurred because of interest of some children to gain knowledge about various aspects of oral health through varied sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The mere presence of dentist in the school and possibility of greater attention provided to the students and a questionnaire is likely to have some influence in motivation for better self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par68">Random sampling technique for selection of school and children is the strength of the study which accounts for representativeness and generalizability of the study among school children of Dharan, Nepal.</p>
                <p id="Par69">Since examiner was not blinded, observational bias might have occurred. No environmental factors and lifestyle changes were taken into consideration. Inherent bias i.e. over-reporting of favorable behaviors (related to oral hygiene practices) can be expected. Difference on the age and the SES at the baseline may have compromised the results. Short follow up is also the limitation of the study.</p>

                <title>Recommendations</title>
                <p id="Par71">The study showed the effectiveness of oral health education program in improving oral hygiene knowledge, attitude and practices, plaque control level and better gingival health in school children of Dharan, Nepal. A further large-scale trial with longer duration of the study should be conducted throughout the country to confirm the findings of this study. School based oral health education program is easy to organize and inexpensive which can improve the oral hygiene cleanliness and gingival health among school children. Such oral health education intervention programs should be included in the academic curriculum of the school which would be effective in developing country like Nepal.</p>
