                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par5">Frequent bacterial plaque buildup at the gingival margin and crevice can provoke an inflammatory reaction in gingival tissues which manifests as gingivitis. Probiotics could serve as a beneficial complementary therapy for treating gingival inflammation. The main aim of this research was to investigate the effect of the <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06 probiotic strain on the treatment of gingivitis.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par7">Patients with gingivitis, who were referred to a private clinic and were systematically healthy, were included in this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were instructed to use either placebo or <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> suspensions for one minute two times a day after tooth-brushing for four weeks. Then, the clinical parameters of gingivitis, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and oral hygiene index (OHI-s), were measured in the first, second, and fourth weeks. A total of forty-two patients were randomly assigned to the experimental (nâ=â21) and control (nâ=â21) groups. The mean age of the experimental and control groups was 29.10 and 28.48, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par9">The mean scores of BOP, GI, PI, and OHI-s reduced over time in both the control and test groups. However, according to the Mann-Whitney test, the difference between the two groups was not significant at the same time intervals (Pââ¥â0.05) and only GI showed a significant difference in the fourth week (GI-3, Pâ=â0.006). Nevertheless, the experimental group experienced a higher overall reduction rate than the control group. The BOP, GI, PI, and OHI-s scores decreased by 0.081, 0.204, 0.186, and 0.172 times in the second week, respectively, resulting from the interaction of time and the intervention, which considerably diminished these indices.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par12">According to the world health organization, oral health is crucial to overall wellness and quality of life. It is described as a state of being without any mouth and facial pain, oral diseases such as tooth cavity, gum disease, tooth loss, oral cancer, and other disorders which can limit a personâs normal activity of chewing, smiling, speaking, and social life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The oral microbiota, the diverse microbial population found in the human mouth cavity, can cause inflammatory conditions, including gingivitis and peri-implant mucositis when its balance is disturbed. As a result, probiotic therapy and oral microbiota replacement therapy have received much attention in recent years as methods of controlling periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Periodontal diseases including gingivitis and periodontitis are among prevalent oral diseases in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Gingivitis is classified in two categories, dental biofilm induced gingivitis and non-dental biofilm induced gingivitis. Dental biofilm induced gingivitis is an inflammatory lesion contained to gingiva without extension to periodontal attachment apparatus. It can be associated with dental biofilms alone, mediated by systemic or local risk factors and drug influenced gingival enlargement. It can occur on intact periodontium or reduced healthy periodontium. It is a reversible condition, so treatment modalities such as antiseptic treatment, mechanical debridement, drug changes, or modification in local risk factors can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Frequent bacterial plaque buildup at the gingival margin and crevice can provoke an inflammatory reaction in gingival tissues which manifests as gingivitis with the main signs of bleeding, swelling, and redness of gums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. If left untreated, this condition may proceed to an advanced and destructive disease known as periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, treating gingivitis is a primarily preventive approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Mechanical removal of dental biofilm through professional scaling and root planning together with regular at-home oral hygiene practice significantly reduces periopathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although mechanical instrumentation is highly effective, microbial recolonization is unpredictable. Also, many people still do not follow oral hygiene guidelines effectively. Therefore, the use of adjunctive antimicrobial agents as chemical plaque control is advised in patients who are more susceptible to gingivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, these chemicals may have adverse effects especially in long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This indicates the need for a safer alternative measure. Recently, there has been increased interest in probiotics, defined as sufficient numbers of live microorganisms that can confer health benefits to the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. They can manipulate the oral microflora by strengthening the resident bacteria and preventing the adhesion and colonization of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several studies have shown positive results concerning reduced plaque accumulation and gingival indices following probiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some studies show that using probiotics can modulate the hostâs immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The effects of different probiotic strains of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> on oral health have previously been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the clinical influences of these probiotic strains regarding gingival inflammation have not been discussed. In a systematic review, the role of probiotics on experimental gingivitis was examined and discussed in detail. A positive effect was observed in which the reduction of gingival crevicular fluid occurred after taking probiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to address the clinical effectiveness of probiotics in treating gingivitis. After analyzing the results obtained from clinical trials, limited evidence was presented to show the beneficial effects of probiotics in reducing inflammatory parameters due to the high heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> strain MK06 is a native probiotic bacterium isolated from traditional dairy products in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given that this probiotic bacterial strain prevents the growth of <italic>streptococcus mutans</italic> (the causal agent of tooth decay), its inhibitory effect on gingivitis and periodontal inflammation was investigated. The effect of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> suspension on gingivitis-related parameters, including BOP, GI, PI, and OHI, was carefully examined compared to placebo suspension.</p>

                  <p id="Par16">In order to isolate the <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> strain, 1 ml of traditionally produced yogurt was dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline and diluted to 1âÃâ10<sup>ââ3</sup> using a 10-fold serial dilution protocol. 0.1 ml of 10-fold dilution was spread on an MRS agar plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for up to 48Â h at 30Â Â°C under aerobic conditions. The colonies were stored in MRS broth supplemented with 50% (v/v) glycerol at -70Â Â°C. The isolate was carefully chosen based on its morphological features and catalase examination. Additional analysis was carefully performed to delineate the probiotic characteristics of the isolate as detailed in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Besides, the 16Â S-rRNA gene analysis using universal primers (27Â F and 1492R) was carried out to further recognize the bacterial isolate. To this end, the extraction of DNA genomic was done using a DNA extraction kit (SinaClon Co., Tehran, Iran), and the 16Â S rRNA gene was amplified through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as descrobed before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The partial sequence of the 16Â S rRNA gene of this strain has been deposited in the NCBI with accession number of MW314598.1.</p>

                  <p id="Par17">At this stage, an optimized medium, which was previously developed in our laboratory, was used to culture probiotic bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This culture medium is composed of whey (40Â g/L), sodium acetate (5Â g/L), peptone (8Â g/L), yeast extract (4Â g/L), magnesium sulfate (0.2Â g/L), ammonium sulfate (2Â g/L), Tween 80 (1Â g/L), yeast extract (industrial, 4 ml/L). All medium components were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). To prepare inoculum, a stock culture of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06 was cultivated twice on an MRS agar medium, and a pure colony was inoculated in an optimal liquid culture medium to prepare pre-culture. The culture medium was then incubated under aerobic conditions at 30Â Â°C and 180Â rpm. After reaching the exponential growth phase, the bacteria were inoculated in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of the optimal culture medium so that the initial OD<sub>600</sub> was 0.1. Bacteria were incubated under the same conditions as pre-culture, and after reaching the mid-exponential growth phase (ODâ=â2), the cells were isolated by centrifugation at 7000 Ãg for 10Â min. The collected cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and re-dissolved in the PBS buffer to prepare the cell solution. 1 ml aliquots were prepared from the bacterial solution in a 1.5 ml vial so that each vial contained 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml. The probiotic powder was then prepared by placing the vials in the freeze-drying overnight.</p>

                  <p id="Par63">The mean BOP scores at baseline (BOP-0) in the intervention and placebo groups were 0.78 and 0.79, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (pâ=â0.999). The mean BOP at four weeks (BOP-3) were 0.59 and 0.69 in the intervention and placebo groups, respectively, in which this difference was not statistically significant (pâ=â0.085). According to the results of the Friedman test, during the study time, the changes in BOP score had a statistically significant decreasing trend in both groups (pâ=â0.001) (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The percentage of BOP changes was 24.35% in the intervention and 12.65% in the placebo groups, which may be clinically significant. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Based on the generalized estimator equations model and considering that the significance of this test is less than 0.05, the time effect was significant (pâ=â0.001). In other words, the difference between the mean of the measurements in different time periods based on the Wald Chi-Square test was significant (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). The results showed that the time factor would significantly reduce the BOP index, so that the longer the consumption time, the more the BOP index decreases. Intergroup changes in the BOP index did not cause a significant difference between the experimental and control groups (pâ=â0.205). A decrease of BOP up to 0.094 times in one week, 0.081 times in two weeks, and 0.0199 times in four weeks occurred after the intervention in the experimental group (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par73">Periodontal disease and peri-implant mucositis/peri-implantitis are significant oral health challenges that can lead to tooth loss and implant failure. Conventional treatments like Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) and mechanical debridement have limitations, leaving a need for alternative approaches to reduce gingival inflammation and improve periodontal health. Probiotics have emerged as a promising option due to their ability to restore microbial balance, inhibit periodontal pathogens, and modulate the immune response. It highlights the potential of probiotics as a suitable alternative treatment to address gingival inflammation in both periodontal disease and peri-implantitis, suggesting their efficacy in improving clinical indices and microbiological parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As we explore the benefits of probiotics in these contexts, the current study investigated the clinical effects of a native potential probiotic strain of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06 on gingivitis treatment. As anticipated, using <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> probiotic suspension served to lessen and treat those factors that trigger gingivitis. While the average scores of all indices BOP, GI, PI, and OHI decreased in both intervention and control groups over time, the rate of this reduction was longer in the experimental group than in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant. In fact, higher improvement was observed in the intervention group, which is clinically significant based on the percentage of parameter changes. Recruiting participants in this clinical trial was one of the most challenging tasks. The limitation in finding patients with gingivitis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria caused the study to be conducted over a long period of time, preventing the study in the wider statistical population. Another limitation of this study was the uncertainty of the correct use of mouthwashes by patients, which tried to reduce its negative impact on the results by teaching proper use. Despite these limitations, however, unlike many previous studies conducted exclusively on children, the present study identified the effects of these probiotics on adults and different genders.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Reports of modest positive effects of probiotics in reducing clinical parameters associated with gingivitis suggest that more rigorous randomized clinical trials are needed to provide conclusive evidence on the efficacy of probiotics in gingivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Many studies have shown the effects of probiotics on clinical and microbiological parameters. These studies have focused on improving periodontal clinical indices and reducing pathogens belonging to the red and orange complexes in periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Probiotic bacteria act by modulating the hostâs immune system, directly competing with other microorganisms, or influencing microbial products. The specific effects of a well-characterized probiotic strain depend on its metabolism and surface molecules and produced bioactive compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In a previous study, the inhibitory effect of different <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> strains against oral pathogens was examined. The highest inhibitory activity was observed for the <italic>L. paracasei</italic>, <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic>, <italic>L. casei</italic>, and <italic>L. salivarius</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although few reports are available on the inhibitory effect of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> in the treatment of gingivitis, the use of different strains of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> with probiotic potential for the treatment of periodontal disease has been increasingly considered in scientific circles related to oral diseases. Therefore, the present study was designed to use a native strain of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06 with potential probiotic properties to reduce important clinical parameters associated with gingivitis.</p>
              <p id="Par75">In a randomized clinical trial, the probiotic bacterial strains <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus pumilus</italic> containing toothpaste, mouthwash, and toothbrush were used for eight weeks after the initial supra-gingival scaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It was stated that there is no statistically significant difference compared to placebo. In the present study, we used a different probiotic strain (<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06) as a suspension without the patients undergoing scaling. The different results observed might be due to professional plaque removal, which may have subsided the effects of probiotics. In another study, after prophylaxis, patients received either a placebo or <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> containing yogurt for twenty-eight days, and clinical measurements were recorded after five days of no brushing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. There was no difference between groups after the consumption of yogurts, but interestingly, significant improvement was observed in all clinical parameters after plaque accumulation. The results were in line with our studyâs results. It is assumed that probiotic products can reduce the progression of the disease if the plaque is not professionally removed. In a previous study, the effect of probiotics and chlorhexidine-oral rinse on plaque buildup and gingival inflammation was examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The plaque index, gingival index, and oral hygiene index scores were recorded after oral prophylaxis at baseline, 14th, and 28th days. A significant difference was observed between both probiotic and chlorhexidine mouth rinse compared to the control. The results of this study were consistent with our results that <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> suspension can improve the clinical parameters associated with gingivitis. The results also suggest that probiotics could be a safe and effective alternative to chlorhexidine mouthwash. In another study, a randomized clinical trial was performed to ascertain whether patients having periodontitis benefit from adjunctive treatment with <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> strains in the form of a gel as applied into periodontal pockets, thereafter taken as lozenges, to conventional scaling and root planing (SRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The primary outcome measure was the number of remaining diseased sites with BOP and PDâ&gt;â4Â mm after three months. The results showed that probiotics were ineffective in reducing the number of persistent pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In contrast, our study was performed on patients with gingivitis, and PDâ&gt;â3Â mm defined as exclusion criteria. Based on the promising results of our trial, it can be assumed that probiotics are more beneficial as a preventive measure in the early stages of periodontal diseases rather than a treatment for more advanced periodontitis. The results of this study show that the use of MK06 probiotic strain suspension has a significant effect in reducing the parameters related to gingivitis over time. The inhibitory ability, along with the lack of toxicity and resistance to probiotics, indicates that the probiotic suspension of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06 can be considered a promising adjunctive therapy for the treatment of gingivitis. However, more extensive clinical trials with further participants are required over an extended period owing to controversial outcomes between available studies. Furthermore, additional randomized clinical trials are required to corroborate the effects of probiotics on microbiological parameters.</p>

              <p id="Par76">The study examined the clinical benefits of the probiotic strain <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> MK06 on the treatment of gingivitis and discovered that it significantly improved gingival indices compared to the control group. Challenges in participant recruitment and uncertainty about mouthwash usage were noted as study limitations. However, the study identified the beneficial effects of probiotics on adults with gingivitis and highlighted their potential as a safe alternative to chlorhexidine mouthwash. The results suggest that probiotics may be more effective as a preventive measure in early-stage periodontal diseases. Further rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate probioticsâ efficacy on microbiological parameters.</p>
