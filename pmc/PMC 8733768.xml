                  <p id="Par1">Early childhood caries is a highly prevalent disease affecting young children. Parental brushing of children’s teeth is recommended during preschool years. Interventions to promote parental brushing of children’s teeth are assessed as a package in randomized clinical trials and the efficacy of separate components is not known.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The aim of this study is to develop an optimized behavior modification intervention to increase parents’ brushing of their pre-school children’s teeth using the multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior. Behavior change will be assessed by the percent reduction in children’s dental plaque index after 6 months and parents reporting of toothbrushing frequency. Two phases of MOST will be carried out. First, the preparation phase comprises the development of a conceptual framework, identifying candidate components, conducting a feasibility pilot study to assess the acceptability and the design features of three intervention components (motivational interviewing (MI), and two mobile health (mHealth) components: oral health promotion messages and storytelling videos delivered using WhatsApp messenger) in addition to setting an optimization objective. Second, the optimization phase constitutes a factorial trial assessing the three intervention components and developing the intervention by selecting the most effective components within the optimization constraint. Each component will be set at two levels: yes (the intervention is applied) and no (the intervention is not applied). A linear regression model will be used to assess the effect of the intervention components on the percent reduction in dental plaque index (primary outcome measure). The secondary outcome measure is the change in the frequency of parents’ brushing of the child’s teeth. The combination of components making up the new optimized intervention will be selected.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic disease affecting children worldwide with high prevalence in Egypt exceeding 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. ECC has adverse effects on the growth and development of children and their quality of life as well as that of their caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Regular toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste is a highly effective home care measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which renders dental health education of caregivers one of the best approaches to control this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Parents are responsible for brushing their children’s teeth at young age to prevent dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends parental supervision of children’s toothbrushing during preschool years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Barriers to parents’ brushing of their children’s teeth include inadequately supportive and organized home environment, absence of flexibility in daily activities, and parenting styles lacking positive reinforcement and involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, the child’s development, level of co-operation, and the surrounding community-level factors may influence toothbrushing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Several theories were proposed to explain health behaviors and how they are affected by various factors and barriers. These theories include the social cognitive theory, the theory of diffusion of innovation, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the health belief model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The TBP was used to decipher barriers to behavior change in oral health education programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], to design behavior change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], to improve interventions by assessing participants’ background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and to promote parental brushing of children’s teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The TPB can guide the development of interventions to promote parents’ brushing of their children’s teeth by addressing the impact of barriers affecting parents’ perceived control, their attitude toward oral health, and the norms they perceive regarding the value of oral hygiene.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Several interventions were developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to promote parents’ brushing of children’s teeth and were assessed using randomized clinical trials (RCTs). These interventions usually consist of multiple components to maximize the efficacy of the intervention and are evaluated as a single package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) assesses the effectiveness of each component in the intervention separately. MOST is an engineering-inspired framework that focuses on developing and optimizing an intervention according to a specific optimization objective so that components of the interventions can later be evaluated for effectiveness as a package in an RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The aim is not only to develop an effective intervention but an efficient one too. Understanding the mechanisms by which an intervention produces its effects makes it possible to build upon previous interventions in a more systematic and gradual means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. MOST consists of three phases: preparation, optimization, and evaluation phases. The preparation phase lays the groundwork for the development of the conceptual framework and the identification of candidate intervention components using a feasibility pilot study. In the optimization phase, the optimized intervention is constructed using optimization trials. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimized intervention can be confirmed in the evaluation phase through an RCT.</p>
              <p id="Par16">We aim to use the MOST framework to engineer a behavior modification intervention to promote parents’ brushing of their pre-school children’s teeth using fluoridated toothpaste and to select intervention components and component levels with the greatest efficacy within a predefined optimization objective. We will select intervention components based on the constructs of the TPB then test them for acceptability in a feasibility pilot study representing the preparation phase of MOST. This will be followed by an optimization factorial design trial to compare the selected components and select the components with the greatest efficacy within predefined optimization objectives.</p>

                    <p id="Par26">The TPB posits that intentions are predictors of behaviors and are affected by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Individuals adopt beliefs about the outcomes of a behavior, and these beliefs contribute to their attitude. Subjective norms are the perception about the expectations of important others, and these contribute to the perception of social pressure and motivation to comply. Perceived control is divided into two components: self-efficacy which is the sense of ease/ difficulty in engaging in the behavior and controllability which is the extent to which the performance is up to the person. Parental attitude, self-efficacy, and intention are modifiable social-cognitive constructs that were reported to be significantly associated with preschool children’s oral hygiene behavior and can be targeted by behavior modification interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the proposed study, each TPB construct will be targeted by a component, and this is assumed to lead to the desired behavior modification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

                    <p id="Par27">Three components are proposed in addition to a core/constant component provided to all participants. The three components are motivational interviewing (MI), oral health promotion messages (OHPM), and storytelling (ST). In a previous study, MI outperformed traditional oral health education in improving patient behaviors and oral health perceptions and enhancing clinical indicators (e.g., plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported that messages based on subjective norms were the most effective in inducing behavioral changes. The use of story-based approaches also showed promising results in improving children’s oral hygiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

                    <p id="Par28"><italic>Constant component</italic>: All participants will receive pamphlets emphasizing the importance of primary teeth, correct feeding habits, recommended sugar intake, and age-appropriate oral hygiene practices. Toothpaste samples will be distributed as tokens of appreciation. This component aims to provide standard basic oral health education and foster engagement and trust.</p>
                    <p id="Par29"><italic>Motivational interviewing</italic>: A single 30–45-min MI session will be offered by one researcher (MI) experienced in motivational interviewing for promoting oral health care. This component will target the perceived control construct of the TPB. The researcher providing the MI will receive training using the MI network of trainers’ resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The MI session includes establishing rapport and encouraging participants to talk about their dental habits and what they want for their children to motivate them to accept changes in behaviors. Options and strategies for improving dental health will be discussed. After the session, parents will be contacted by phone every 2 months, for 6 months, to reinforce commitment to the new behavior and provide support. Without follow-up, new behaviors may not be maintained or even tried leading to relapse.</p>
                    <p id="Par30"><italic>Oral health promotion messages</italic>: Teledentistry and mobile health (mHealth) are proving to be an effective tool for the promotion of oral health in various age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. mHealth components will be incorporated in the proposed study to reduce the time needed for parents to receive health education, adhere to physical distancing in the time of COVID-19, and make use of the popularity of these tools among the younger generations. A series of unique messages targeting the subjective norms construct of the TBP will be developed by the researchers (MI, MET, and WE) and sent to the parents using the WhatsApp Messenger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The messages are based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and are modified to fit the proposed study. The validity, acceptability, preferred frequency, and timing of messages will be determined in the feasibility pilot study of the preparation phase (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Based on the frequency, the number of messages will be determined so that they are spread over the study period.</p>
                    <p id="Par31">The following are examples of the messages:</p>
                    <p id="Par32">“{name}, this is {dentist} from {clinic}. Did you know that brushing your children’s teeth twice daily using a toothbrush and toothpaste will help them have a nicer smile in front of their friends and family?”</p>

                    <p id="Par35"><italic>Storytelling videos</italic>: Via WhatsApp messenger, the parents will receive another mHealth component: a series of 1-min videos targeting the attitude construct of the TPB and prepared by the investigators (MI, MET, and WE). The videos have a scenario narrating the experiences of parents whose children suffered from ECC, emphasizing the positive effect of tooth brushing and fluoridated toothpaste in controlling ECC, and enhancing children’s oral hygiene. The preferred frequency and timing of the videos will also be assessed during the preparation phase (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and based on the frequency; the number of videos will be determined.</p>

                    <p id="Par47">The optimization objective is to develop an intervention that fits within the time a parent is willing to spend receiving health education to support him/her to brush their child’s teeth. This objective may be more relevant in the mother and child health centers where the optimized intervention is planned to be provided. In this setting, parents receive ante- and post-natal care including health education. These services are provided free of charge by salaried providers, and thus, financial constraints and provider time may not be appropriate constraining factors. The key constraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in the present study is the time the parent is willing to spend receiving the components. This time should cover commuting to and from the clinic to receive MI, the time of the phone call reminders for MI, the time to read the WhatsApp messages, and that spent watching the videos.

Factorial designs are preferred for comparing the three components for two reasons. Firstly, factorial experiments separate component effects, enabling the estimation of the main effect and interactions between components. Secondly, factorial trials are efficient compared to alternative designs because they require fewer participants to achieve the same statistical power.

The four surfaces of each tooth will be scored from 0 to 3 and the scores will be averaged per tooth. The scores of the six teeth will be averaged to obtain the mean PlI of the child. The outcome measure is the percent reduction in dental plaque scores calculated as: [(plaque score after 3 or 6 months − plaque score at baseline)/ plaque score at baseline] × 100.

              <p id="Par77">This study adopts an innovative research method to develop an efficient and scalable behavior modification intervention based on participants’ acceptance and preferences using components that are likely to accommodate the conditions during the time of the pandemic. The literature about young children’s oral hygiene provides little guidance on optimal intervention designs and existing evidence describes components which vary in effectiveness. Little is known from the literature about the underlying theoretical framework, form, and dose of interventions to elicit effective behavior change. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] used packages of multiple interventions but none of them assessed the efficacy of individual components. Our study is considered the first to apply the MOST framework in the field of dentistry. Through MOST, we hope to isolate the components then assemble an efficacious standalone intervention package that fits the optimization criterion.</p>
