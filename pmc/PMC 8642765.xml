                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Xylitol use is reported to be able to reduce dental plaque amount and cariogenic bacteria and, as a consequence, the caries increment. Only few data on the oral health of Ladakh’s population are available. The aim of the present protocol will be to record the caries prevalence of primary and permanent molars of schoolchildren living in Ladakh and to implement a school-based Xylitol programme, named the <italic>Ca</italic>ries <italic>Pre</italic>vention <italic>X</italic>ylitol in <italic>Ch</italic>ildren (CaPreXCh) trial, using chewing gums.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The protocol is designed as a triple-blind randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial in children aged 5–14 years. The study should have been carried out from August 2021 to August 2024 in Zanskar Valley (Ladakh), but the COVID-19 pandemic does not allow today to make predictions on the exact start. Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: subjects who will receive a chewing gum with Xylitol (70% w/v) as only sweetener, and those who will receive a sugared chewing gum containing Maltitol (23% w/v). The subjects will be instructed to chew a total of 6 pellets for 5 min divided into 3 intakes a day (2 in the morning, 2 after the midday meal and 2 in the afternoon) for one school year. Clinical examination will comprise an oral examination in which caries index (ICDAS scores), bleeding on probing and plaque pH evaluation after sucrose challenge will be recorded at baseline (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>); the clinical examination will be repeated after 12 months since the beginning of the chewing gum administration period (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>), after another 12-month period (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>) and finally after further 12 months (<italic>t</italic><sub>3</sub>) (24 months from the end of the chewing gum use). The primary outcome will be the caries increment measured both at enamel and dentinal levels on primary and permanent molars. Data analysis will be conducted through Kaplan-Meyer graphs to evaluate caries increment. A comparison of the methods will be carried out with Cox regression with shared frailty. The net caries increment for initial, moderate and severe caries levels, using ICDAS (Δ-initial, Δ-moderate and Δ-severe), will be calculated.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial will be the first trial conducted in India assessing the efficacy of a school-based caries preventive programme through the use of chewing gum containing only Xylitol as a sweetener. The findings could help strengthen the evidence for the efficacy of Xylitol use in community-based caries prevention programmes in children.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par11">Ladakh is a region administered by India, covering an area slightly larger than Croatia; it is part of the larger region of Kashmir and Jammu, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China since 1947. The Indian Government reports Ladakh to be one of the districts that are below health service and condition standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The complex terrain and the high altitude, above 9000 ft, is responsible for the cold weather, a limited diet, a limited availability of drinking water and the poor socioeconomic conditions, factors affecting the population’s wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The Italian National Association of Dentists Foundation (ANDI Foundation) has among its main aims that of improving the quality of life of populations with socioeconomic inequalities in various parts of the world, as the population living in the Zanskar Valley of Ladakh. Dental care is currently limited to small dental clinics, as at the medical centre in Padum (CHC, community health centre). During summertime, when the valley is accessible, teams of volunteers from the Italian National Dentistry Association (ANDI) Foundation work as dentists at the Padum’s facility and promote oral health in schools.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Oral health data on the population living in Ladakh are poor. A recent survey performed on schoolchildren living in Ladakh showed that caries was almost ubiquitarian with only 10% of caries-free children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Caries severity, in both primary and permanent dentitions, was statistically significantly related to gender, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), oral hygiene frequency and self-reported chewing problems. An increasing relative risk for caries in permanent dentition compared to caries-free subjects was observed in children with a low BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The frequent intake of fermentable carbohydrates with the diet favours a high plaque cariogenicity, increasing the possibility of demineralization of enamel and dentin; the acidic environment of the plaque in turn promotes the growth of cariogenic bacteria, further increasing the caries risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As a consequence, different preventive approaches of caries prevention have focused on the reduction of sugar intake and its replacement with non-fermentable sweeteners, such as Xylitol. Polyols were proposed as an anti-caries agent since the 1970s, delivered mostly through chewing gum. Xylitol-based caries prevention programmes have been carried out in children and adults, showing the capacity of the polyol in reducing caries risk factors and caries incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. An advantage of using Xylitol in caries prevention programmes is that it does not require specifically trained personnel for its administration, since it can be easily given both at home by parents and at school by teachers even in less served areas of the earth.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Although encouraging results were obtained in children in ten RCT studies, the quality of evidence was rated as very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], calling for the need of well-conducted and methodological sound trials. Moreover, the use of Xylitol for caries control is considered a preventive method that might encounter dietary-cultural obstacles, especially in countries where polyol and or chewing gum use are not frequently consumed, and this aspect needs also to be further investigated.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Recently, a chewing gum sweetened with Xylitol only was proposed. A preliminary study showed that this product is able to increase significantly the Xylitol concentration in saliva compared to the level obtained using a chewing gum containing different polyols. Furthermore, the chewing gum also demonstrated to have the capacity of reducing bacterial strains related to caries and periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">The aim of the present protocol will be to register the caries prevalence of schoolchildren living in Ladakh and to implement a school-based Xylitol programme using chewing gums in order to reduce caries incidence.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par18">This is the third and final version of the protocol (edited on the 15th of May 2021). A superiority trial is designed to detect a difference between treatments as a triple-blind randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Two groups will be compared: subjects who will receive a Xylitol chewing gum with the polyol as the only sweetener (70% w/v), and those who will receive sugared gum containing a 23% (w/v) Maltitol. The flowchart of the study design is displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The flowchart of the study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2021_5828_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par19">The investigation will have an experimental period of one school year (approximately 9 months in total). The study will gain the approval of all the schools’ authorities.

                  <title>Preliminary epidemiological survey</title>
                  <p id="Par30">A team of four dentists received training to diagnose caries lesions using the WHO-DMFT index for permanent teeth and the dmft for primary teeth. The team received training, and inter-examiner reliability was assessed before the start of the study; sensitivity, specificity, percentage agreement and kappa statistics were recorded. Inter-examiner reliability ranged from 0.75 to 0.84 (K-Cohen) for sound teeth and from 0.82 to 0.88 for caries lesions. Intra-examiner reliability ranged from 0.82 to 0.90 for sound teeth and from 0.84 to 0.91 for caries lesions. Dental caries prevalence (dt/DT) and severity (number of lesions) were recorded for caries at the dentinal lesion level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Every subject was examined using a plain mirror (Hahnenkratt, Königsbach, Germany) and the WHO CPI ballpoint probe (Asa-Dental, Milan, Italy), under standard light. No bitewing radiographs or fibre-optic trans-illumination were used.</p>
                  <p id="Par31">An ad hoc prepared questionnaire assessed general health, eating habits, oral hygiene and the self-perception of oral conditions, based on previous surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The height (cm) and the weight (kg) were measured and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The waist circumference was also measured.</p>
                  <p id="Par32">Caries was almost ubiquitarian with only 10.04% of caries-free children (dt/DT = 0). Caries severity, in both primary and permanent dentitions, was statistically significantly related to gender and waist circumference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). This preliminary epidemiological survey will allow to design the intervention trial.</p>

                <p id="Par33">After obtaining actual caries data, schools with similar numbers of schoolchildren (at least 300 subjects per school) will be selected for the preventive project. The participants will be randomized, taking as cluster the school class, allocating each class into one of the two groups of the study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>):</p>
                <p id="Par34">(1) The first group (Xyl) will receive sugar-free gums containing 70% (w/v) Xylitol as the only sweetener</p>
                <p id="Par35">(2) The second group (Pol) will receive reduced sugared gums containing 23% (w/v) Maltitol</p>
                <p id="Par36">Both groups of children will receive a total of 6 pellets of chewing gum a day during a period of one school year (about 9 months). All chewing gums will be produced and supplied by Perfetti Van Melle SpA (Lainate, Italy). All types of chewing gums will weigh 1.4 g each and will be identical in colour, shape and taste.</p>

                  <p id="Par37">Clinical examination, coordinated by E.C. as responsible of the coordinating centre, will comprise an oral examination (caries index, bleeding on probing recording) and an evaluation of plaque pH fluctuation after the sucrose challenge. Bleeding on probing will be used as a proxy of plaque presence, since there is a causal relationship between bleeding on probing and amount of plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par38">The subjects will be examined using a mouth mirror, a ball-ended probe and artificial light. Caries registration will be performed with regard to the first and second primary, and first and second permanent, molars. The International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) will be used to record caries at tooth level as initial, moderate or severe lesions, the number of filled teeth and the missing teeth for caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Initial caries lesion can be defined as a primary lesion, which has not reached the stage of an established lesion with cavitation (ICDAS scores 1 and 2). Moderate caries lesions are defined as white or brown spot lesion with localized enamel breakdown or an underlying dentine shadow without visible dentine exposure (ICDAS scores 3 and 4). Extensive caries lesions are defined as a distinct cavity in opaque or discoloured enamel with visible dentine (ICDAS scores 5 and 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Thus, the total daily intake of Xylitol in the Xyl group will be 5.8 g, whilst, in the Pol group, the amount of administered Maltitol will be 1.9 g. Subjects will be instructed to use the chewing gum immediately after the main meals and snacks. Parents/guardians will not be requested to make changes in the dietary and oral hygiene habits of their children. Tooth brushing will not be allowed for at least 1 h after the chewing gum use. All subjects will receive a fluoridated toothpaste containing 1450 μg/g NaF and a manual toothbrush, which will be substituted every 3 months throughout the entire experimental period (3 years).

                <p id="Par53">Data on caries will be recorded considering the tooth as the unit of analysis. The progression or change of status can be described with three modalities: 1—as the change from no caries stage to initial stage or to moderate stage or extensive; 2—as the change from initial stage to moderate or extensive stage; and 3—as the change from moderate stage to extensive stage. The net caries increment for initial, moderate and extensive caries levels, using ICDAS (Δ-initial, Δ-moderate and Δ-extensive), will be calculated in primary and permanent molars. Differences between groups in terms of caries increment will be evaluated using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Data analysis will be conducted through Kaplan–Meyer graphs to evaluate caries increment. A comparison of the methods will be carried out with Cox regression with shared frailty. The calculation of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy will consider the results obtained with the indices and the classification of caries lesion presence by the proposed reference standard. The cost-effectiveness ratio will also be verified, considering as effectiveness the prevention of the primary outcome. For all tests, two-tailed analyses will be used, considering a level of significance of 5%. The quality-adjusted life-year index (QALY) will be calculated to assess the value of the preventive intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To determine QALYs, the utility value associated with a given state of health by the years lived in that state will be calculated.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par64">Dental caries continues to be one of the most prevalent human diseases worldwide. The actual skewed caries figure suggests the need of implementing effective preventive approaches, especially for high-risk groups such as children living in low socioeconomic contests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The children population living in the remote valley of Zanskar in Ladakh has shown a very high caries prevalence and still no caries preventive programme at the school level has ever been implemented. Due to the lack of dental facilities in the area, a school-based preventive programme seems to be the most effective strategy to reach children. Since caries is a behaviour-related disease, especially in children, different caries-preventive measures have been proposed, such as using sugar substitutes. Sugar-free chewing gums, especially those containing Xylitol, were effectively administered to reduce caries-associated risk factors and caries lesion increment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par65">A randomized controlled trial is considered the most powerful study design, in which at least two interventions are contemporaneously administered to two or more groups of subjects forming the arms of the trial. The random enrolment into each arm reduces the potential risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Randomization is generally performed at an individual level. However, a group-randomized design may be useful in situations where there is a presumed lack of feasibility of carrying out the intervention at the individual level or/and when researchers aim to obtain findings on the intervention effect at the group level, as it happens with the school-based intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. School-based programmes are effective strategies to improve oral health among schoolchildren, particularly among underprivileged groups of children at high caries risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Promoting children’s health through schools is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par66">Just one recent paper assesses the salivary concentration of xylitol released from two chewing gums containing different amounts of the polyol in a sample of healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] so the proposed trial will be first clinical trial aiming to evaluate and understand the use of chewing gums with Xylitol as the only sweetener. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this will be the first clinical trial to assess the effect of a sugar-free Xylitol chewing gum on caries prevention in a population with special living conditions like that of Ladakh. The hypothesis under evaluation is that there will be a statistically significant difference between the interventions regarding caries increment. The findings will contribute to strengthen the evidence for the efficacy of Xylitol use in community-based caries prevention programmes in children.</p>
