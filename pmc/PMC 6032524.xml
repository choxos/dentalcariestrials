                  <p id="Par1">Dental caries in primary teeth is prevalent, affecting millions of children around the world. Functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP) has been incorporated into sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish to enhance the remineralization process. NaF varnish with the adjunctive application of silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) solution is effective in arresting dentine caries. So far, there is no published randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of the adoption of AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and NaF varnish containing fTCP in arresting dentine caries in preschool children. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution plus a 5% NaF varnish containing fTCP and a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution plus a 5% NaF varnish in arresting coronal dentine caries among preschool children when applied semi-annually over a 30-month period.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This is a randomized, double-blind controlled trial. The null hypothesis tested is that no difference exists between the effectiveness of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution plus a 5% NaF varnish with fTCP and a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution plus a 5% NaF varnish in arresting dentine caries in preschool children when applied semi-annually. According to the sample size calculation, approximately 2000 3- to 4-year-old kindergarten children will be screened, and at least 408 children with coronal dentine caries will be recruited. The children will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups via stratified randomization: group A – biannual application of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish, and group B – biannual application of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish with fTCP. Clinical examinations will be conducted every 6 months to assess whether the carious lesions have become arrested (primary outcome). Confounding factors, such as demographic background and oral hygiene behaviors, will be collected through a parental questionnaire.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">Dental caries in primary teeth is a common chronic disease in childhood. It has been ranked as the 12th most prevalent condition, affecting around 560 million children worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Southeast Asian countries, caries prevalence in preschool children is very high (79%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and around half (57%) of Hong Kong’s preschool children have dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These affected children may suffer from tooth pain and infection, possibly resulting in a serious systemic infection with severe complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Poor dentition also affects children’s growth, development and general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, dental caries has been reported as a common cause of school absenteeism in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, children from families with lower household incomes who have limited access to dental care have higher caries prevalence and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this context, conventional restorative treatments are often costly and unaffordable for these underprivileged children. In addition, it is a challenge for young children to tolerate the lengthy and complicated procedures of restorative treatment. Therefore, a noninvasive and unsophisticated treatment is required to tackle the burden of dental caries in young children. This study will adopted a non-surgical strategy to arrest dentine caries in primary teeth of preschool children.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish with functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP)</title>
                <p id="Par16">Results of systematic reviews have suggested that the progression of dental caries could be slowed down or halted without operative procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The application of various topical fluoride agents has been reported to be effective in managing dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fluoride varnish is one of the most commonly applied topical fluoride agents. It can adhere to tooth surfaces for longer times and acts as slow-releasing reservoirs of fluoride. A Cochrane review concluded that NaF varnish had a substantial caries-inhibiting effect on primary teeth with an estimated 37% of pooled caries being prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another review also found that 5% NaF varnish is effective in remineralizing early enamel caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par17">To enhance the remineralization process, fTCP has been recently incorporated into NaF varnish. fTCP is a novel calcium phosphate system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Calcium and phosphate ions are the primary minerals of the tooth structure. Adequate quantities of both ions must be present to promote ion deposition in a medium during the remineralization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. fTCP works synergistically with fluoride and controls the delivery of calcium and phosphate ions to the tooth substrate. Several laboratory studies on fluoride containing fTCP showed promising results in improving fluoride’s activity and enhancing the remineralization of carious lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recently, a study found that silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) and NaF with fTCP reduced the damage of dentine caries by cariogenic biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although laboratory studies revealed favorable results of incorporating fTCP with NaF varnish for caries management, the question remains as to whether NaF containing fTCP is clinically superior to NaF varnish alone.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Despite its caries-preventive effect, NaF varnish is ineffective at arresting coronal dentine caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Adjunctive application of AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by application of NaF varnish has been advocated to improve caries-arrest effectiveness.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Adjunctive application of AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and NaF varnish</title>
                <p id="Par19">AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution has been used as an antimicrobial agent for years. However, the adoption of AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution diminished because of the discovery of fluoride for caries management in the mid-nineteenth century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Because AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution has strong antibacterial properties and NaF varnish has remineralizing properties, the application of AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by NaF varnish was reintroduced to manage caries in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A retrospective study conducted in the United States reported that more than 5000 children were treated with this protocol, and the results revealed that almost all cavitated dentine lesions became arrested after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Subsequently, the number of young children requiring full-mouth rehabilitation under general anesthesia decreased substantially. An in vitro study also confirmed the caries-arresting effect of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish in remineralizing artificial dentine caries and inhibiting the degradation of collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A 12-month randomized clinical trial showed no difference between silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish in arresting dentine caries among preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par20">So far, there is no published randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of the adoption of AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and NaF varnish containing fTCP in arresting dentine caries in preschool children.</p>

                <title>Clinical examination</title>
                <p id="Par27">Clinical examination of the children will be performed mainly through a careful visual inspection with the aid of a World Health Organization CPI probe (405/WHO probe, Otto Leibinger, Mühlheim, Germany) and a disposable dental mirror with an attached light-emitting diode for intra-oral illumination (MirrorLite, Kudos Crown Limited, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China). Tooth status (decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) scores), tooth mobility and tooth discoloration will be recorded. Caries will be diagnosed at the cavitation level. The visual-tactile assessment will be adopted to assess the status of carious lesions. They will be gently explored with a CPI probe in the centre of the lesion. Great care will be taken to avoid damaging the tooth. For the posterior teeth, all five surfaces (buccal, lingual, mesial, distal and occlusal) will be assessed, while four surfaces (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) of the anterior teeth will be examined.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The oral hygiene status will be measured using the Visible Plaque Index (VPI). The buccal and lingual surfaces of six index teeth (55, 51, 63, 71, 75 and 83) will be examined. The presence or absence of visible plaque on the carious surface will also be recorded. No dental radiograph will be taken because this study will be conducted in a school-based setting.</p>
                <p id="Par29">A trained dentist will perform the examinations (baseline and follow-ups) throughout the 30-month study. The intra-examiner agreement on the plaque and caries assessment will be performed in 10% of the children at each stage of the study.</p>

To assess the children’s oral-health-related quality of life, the translated and validated Chinese-language Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) will be adopted in the parental questionnaire. The questionnaires will also assess parental satisfaction with their child’s oral health and dental esthetics. In the follow-up questionnaire, parents of the study children will also be asked to report the post complications of assigned treatments, such as pain, from a treated tooth and gingival irritation around a treated tooth.</p>

The children will be then allocated by a stratified randomization method with a block size of 6 into two groups. The allocation sequence will be generated by a technician who will not be involved in the oral examination and patient allocation. A pile of sealed opaque envelopes with the allocation numbers will be prepared. Those envelopes will be held by a dental assistant in the field.

Children’s compliance to fluoride treatment will be recorded and monitored at each treatment visit by an assistant. A double-blinding arrangement will be conducted in this clinical trial. One examiner will perform all the clinical examinations during the study period. The examiner will be blinded to the treatment allocation.

                <p id="Par34">Two intervention groups in this study are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par35">Group A: a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (25% silver nitrate, Gordon Labs, Carson, CA, USA) followed by a 5% NaF varnish (Nupro White Varnish, Dentsply, York, PA, USA),</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Group B: a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (25% silver nitrate, Gordon Labs, Carson, CA, USA) followed by a 5% NaF varnish with fTCP (Clinpro White Varnish, 3 M, St. Paul, MN, USA).</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par37">After applying the solution and varnish on the carious lesion(s) for arrest purposes, the assigned 5% NaF varnish (0.25 ml) will be applied on all tooth surfaces of each child to prevent dental caries according to their assigned treatment group. After the treatment, the children will be instructed not to eat or drink for 30 min. The intervention will be provided every 6 months.</p>
                <p id="Par38">An individual report on the child’ s oral health status will be distributed to the parents or guardians with a note asking them to report to the study dentist if there are any adverse effects on the treated tooth and/or the surrounding gum and mucosa after treatment. A referral letter will be provided to seek the appropriate dental treatment if needed. Parents and teachers will be informed that if the treatment has successfully arrested the carious lesions, yellow and soft carious surfaces will become hard and black in color.</p>

The same diagnostic criteria, equipment and clinical procedures that were used in the baseline examination will be adopted in the follow-up evaluations. The caries status (dmfs index) and oral health status (VPI) of the children will be recorded. In addition, the status of the carious surfaces included in the study at baseline examination and the presence of visible plaque on those carious surfaces will be assessed. Newly developed carious lesions will be recorded and treated with the assigned treatment intervention. The examiner will also look for related side/adverse effects, including blackening of the treated carious surfaces, discolored teeth, tooth mobility and abscess formation during the follow-up oral examinations. Reasons for tooth loss prior to follow-up will be recorded.</p>

                <p id="Par40">Outcome measures will be collected at baseline and semi-annually thereafter for 30 months. The primary outcome measure of this study is the proportion of soft (active) carious surfaces that become hardened (arrested). Lesion activity will be assessed based on visual and tactile sensation. A lesion will be recorded as active if softness is detected upon gentle probing, and it will be classified as arrested caries if the lesion is hard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">The secondary outcome measure is the caries increment or the change in the dmfs score over time, which will be measured by a calibrated dental examiner who is masked to the group assignment. Visual and tactile inspection without x-rays will be adopted.</p>

                <title>Sample size and power calculation</title>
                <p id="Par42">The results of previous clinical trials showed that around 70% of the active dentine caries became arrested after 30 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The anticipated caries-arresting rates of group B would be 80%. An absolute difference of 10% for the caries-arresting rates between treatment groups is considered to be clinically significant. The sample size calculation is based on the expected proportion of caries that become arrested, with the power of the study set at 90% (<italic>β</italic> = 0.1) and a two-sided 95% confidence interval (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05) as the statistical significance level by using the G*Power Version 3.1.9.2 (Franz Faul, Universität Kiel, Germany). Therefore, at least 820 active carious tooth surfaces need to be included, or 410 in each study group. Based on the results of epidemiological surveys, we anticipate that the mean number of active caries tooth surfaces of 3-year-old children in Hong Kong is approximately three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The intraclass correlation coefficient for dental caries data at the surface level within the individual would be approximately 0.13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Following the equation for the required sample size in a multilevel study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the design effect will be 1.26. Thus, the estimated sample size would be at least 346 children, or 173 per group. The anticipated dropout rate is 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; thus, 408 children (204 children in each group) will be needed at baseline.</p>

                <p id="Par44">An intra-examiner agreement in the diagnosis of dental caries will be assessed by Cohen’s Kappa statistics. An intention-to-treat analysis will be undertaken.

                <p id="Par46">Because more than one carious lesion may be included from one child, these lesions will possibly be correlated or clustered. Therefore, an adjustment of the clustering effect will be required. Multilevel logistic regression analysis will be adopted to assess the relative effectiveness of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> and a 5% NaF varnish with or without fTCP in arresting dentine caries. A two-level model will be used: level 1, tooth surface level, and level 2, subject level. Multilevel logistic regression models with a clustering effect adjustment will be performed to analyze the effect of independent variables on the caries-arresting outcomes at the 12-, 18- and 30-month follow-ups. Besides treatment group assignment, other potential variables, such as demographic characteristics (sex and age), oral hygiene status, oral-health-related behaviors, level of parental education, family income, caries condition (baseline dmfs scores, tooth position, lesion site and presence of plaque on lesion), also will be included in the model as covariates.</p>

              <p id="Par49">This is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial aiming to investigate the caries-arresting effectiveness of the semi-annual application of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish with/without fTCP among preschool children. The caries-preventive effect, parental satisfaction, changes in oral-health-related quality of life of the study children and the adverse effects of the two intervention groups also will be evaluated.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Due to the limitations of the study, the use of dental radiographs is unavailable and unsafe when conducting a trial in kindergartens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The visual-tactile inspection without x-rays will be adopted for assessing the lesion activity at baseline and follow-up examinations, which is similarly to other caries-arresting studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To generalize the research findings to general populations, the recruited children will not be asked to change their routine oral care practices including the use of fluoride toothpaste and tooth-brushing habits. Instead, the data of oral care practice habits will be collected by questionnaires and analyzed as confounding factors. The 30-month study period is optimal to investigate the effect of caries-arresting treatment in the long run. The follow-up examinations, which will be conducted every 6 months, will provide the trends or changes of lesion activities over 30 months after receiving the intervention. After finishing this study, all recruited children will be eligible to attend primary schools, and the decayed teeth can be restored by School Dental Care Service which is provided by the Department of Health for primary school students in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Although clinical trials have demonstrated that SDF is effective in arresting dentine caries in primary teeth, there was a significant increase of new caries development during the trials, as SDF is only applied on the existing cavitated lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the application of NaF varnish following SDF application at the same visit may increase the risk of fluoride toxicity. It should be noted that SDF is still unavailable in many countries. An alternative to arrest caries using a 5% NaF varnish applied following a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; however, there is a lack of information regarding the preventive effect. Several laboratory studies have shown the anti-caries properties of NaF containing fTCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but the clinical efficacy remains unknown. This study will adopt the commercially available product with fTCP, exclusively from 3 M (Clinpro White Varnish), which contains 5% NaF and fTCP less than 5% by weight. The results of the present study will be novel and will provide information regarding the preventive and arresting effect of the application of NaF varnish with/without fTCP following the application of a 25% AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution in preschool children.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Because the proposed caries management method in this study is simple, noninvasive and low cost, it can be widely recommended and adopted for caries prevention and caries arrest in young children, children with special needs or those living in disadvantaged communities. The results of this study will be beneficial for clinicians and dental health policy-makers when adopting noninvasive approaches to tackle the burden of early childhood caries.</p>
