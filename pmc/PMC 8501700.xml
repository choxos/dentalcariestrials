                  <p id="Par1">The traditional spoon-feeding approach to introduction of solid foods during the complementary feeding period is supported by consensus in the scientific literature. However, a method called Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS (BLISS) has been proposed as an alternative, allowing infants to self-feed with no adult interference. To date, there have been no trials in the Brazilian population to evaluate the effectiveness of BLISS in comparison to the traditional approach.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">To evaluate and compare three different complementary feeding methods. Data on 144 mother-child pairs will be randomized into intervention groups by methods: (A) strict Parent-Led Weaning; (B) strict Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS; and (C) a mixed method. Prospective participants from Porto Alegre, Brazil, and nearby cities will be recruited through the Internet. The interventions will be performed by nutritionists and speech therapists, at 5.5 months of age of the child, at a private nutrition office equipped with a test kitchen where meals will be prepared according to the randomized method. The pairs will be followed up at 7, 9, and 12 months of age. Data will be collected through questionnaires designed especially for this study, which will include a 24h child food recall, questionnaires on the child’s and parents’ eating behavior, oral habits, eating difficulties, and choking prevalence. At 12 months of age, children will undergo blood collection to measure hemoglobin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein, saliva collection for analysis of genetic polymorphisms, and oral examination. Anthropometric parameters (child and maternal) will be measured at the baseline intervention, at a 9 month home visit, and at the end-of-study visit at the hospital. The primary outcome will be child growth and nutritional status <italic>z</italic>-scores at 12 months; secondary outcomes will include iron status, feeding behavior, acceptability of the methods, dietary variety, choking, eating behaviors, food preferences, acceptance of bitter and sweet flavors, suction, oral habits, oral hygiene behavior, dental caries, gingival health status, and functional constipation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">Complementary feeding (CF) is the process of introducing solid and liquid foods other than breast milk or infant formula to an infant’s diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The CF period represents the transition from milk feeding to solid foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over the past half-decade, researchers have started to conduct studies about specific approaches to CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the last decade, an alternative approach named Baby-Led Weaning (BLW) which consists of allowing the infant to make their own food choices, deciding the quantity and sensory characteristics of food according to their own energy needs, has been widely disseminated through digital media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This method suggests offering food in pieces, strips, or sticks and claims that CF should not be influenced by the imposition of caregivers, who generally assume what and how much food the child needs and wants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Currently, the Brazilian guideline recommends traditional spoon-feeding based on responsive feeding and suggests that soft foods can be offered to the child to handle if they are large pieces, and that meals have their consistency gradually progressed until, at twelve months of age, they reach a food consistency used by the child family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Considering several questions raised by parents and healthcare professionals regarding the BLW method, such as possible risks of choking and inadequate supply of iron and calories, a group of New Zealand professionals created a modified version of this approach, which they named Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS (BLISS). The BLISS recommendations are the same as those of the BLW method, with some additional advice, including offer food shaped in large pieces, which the infant can hold by himself; guarantee one source of iron-rich food at each meal; offer a high-calorie food at each meal; offer prepared foods in a texture that reduces the risk of choking, and avoid foods listed as high risk of aspiration; always try the food before offering it to the infant, to check it does not become solid in the oral cavity; avoid round or coin-shaped foods; and ensure that the infant is seated, erect, and under supervision of an adult. A study compared the BLW and BLISS approaches, where BLISS participants received two intervention visits, resources, and on-call support, while BLW participants received no intervention. Findings showed that the BLISS intervention allowed to increase the offerings and variety of iron-containing foods and to reduce the offering of high-choking-risk foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Although the Brazilian guideline for CF has been reviewed and republished recently, the conventional method, Parent-Led Weaning (PLW), is still advised, and there are no recommendations for a baby-guided approach in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Likewise, the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidance proposes pureed foods in the early stages of CF, with consistency progressing gradually along the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Within this context, the present study intends to contribute to the following outcomes:</p>

                <p id="Par27">A nutritionally adequate diet is essential throughout childhood and especially crucial in the first 3 years of life, which are a critical period for growth faltering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previously known as failure to thrive, growth faltering is defined as a current weight or rate of weight gain lower when compared to those of average children of the same age and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is related to many organic and nonorganic causes, including oral and motor function, which has raised concerns among healthcare professionals as to how efficiently an infant would be able to self-feed in terms of quantity as well as how motivated an infant would be to lead the feeding process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">It is still unclear whether a Baby-Led method would interfere with the growth process. The evidence available to date has not found any children with faltering growth, nor any significant differences in growth rate between the CF groups at 12 months, although recommendations about offering a high-calorie food with each meal were given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another study was designed to analyze this outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], however, did not use the BLISS recommendations for energy intake, and assessed different ages. A case-controlled study examined children aged 20 to 78 months and found that spoon-fed ones appeared to be more obese (<italic>z</italic>-score &gt; + 3), while the incidence of underweight (<italic>z</italic>-score &lt; − 3) was higher in the BLW group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A year after this study, a longitudinal investigation of self-reported weight in a sample aged 18 to 24 months found that children weaned with the standard method were more likely to be overweight (19.12% versus 8.1% in the BLW group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

The literature suggests that early eating practices play an important role in the prevalence of iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Anemia is defined as the condition in which the blood hemoglobin concentration is two standard deviations below the reference for age, sex, and height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; 50% of cases are due to iron deficiency. It is estimated that about 25% of Brazilian children under age 3 years have IDA, and the promotion of breastfeeding, healthy eating habits, and prophylactic iron supplementation have long been employed as strategies to prevent this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

Caregivers’ encouragement of healthy eating and the responsibility and supervision of feeding was associated with reasonable children’s eating behaviors, especially low children’s emotional eating, infrequent satiety responsiveness, and food fussiness behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The authoritative style of parenting has a significant negative direct effect on children’s including emotional overeating and food fussiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additionally, high parent-centered feeding along with high child-centered feeding styles was associated with improved diet quality and the lowest percentage of overweight and obese children in a study of Latino families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par32">A study of 565 parents with toddlers aged 12 to 36 months in the United Kingdom found that parents who were following a strict, predominantly BLW style used less instrumental feeding practices, exerted significantly less control over their toddler’s eating, used significantly less encouragement to increase food consumption, shared their mealtimes, and ate the same meals with their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

                <p id="Par33">A Baby-Led approach to complementary feeding has been suggested to increase dietary variety and exposure to more textured foods at a young age. According to Morison et al. (2018), at 7 months of age, BLISS participants had greater total food variety with no difference in fruit and vegetable variety. However, at 24 months of age, BLISS children had greater variety in fruits and vegetables compared to traditionally spoon-fed children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">BLW researchers suggest that a baby-guided approach leads to healthier food choices, since there is greater fruit and vegetable exposure and variety, as well as greater participation in family meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

                <title>Food preferences</title>
                <p id="Par37">The strongest predictors of food preferences in childhood are whether the child likes how food tastes; how long they were breastfed, and, while breastfeeding, what their mothers were eating; and whether they were offered and ate these foods at an early age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, food choices are strongly associated with sensory properties, leading to acceptance or aversion to certain foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The sensation of flavor is formed by a complex combination of taste, smell, and somatosensory information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">Variations in taste perception among individuals can also shape flavor preferences, influencing dietary intake and long-term eating habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that genetic variations related to bitter taste, for instance, may be related to acceptance of feeding introduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], to food selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and higher daily energy density from snacks in children aged 3 to 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Sucrose is known to be an essential risk factor for the development of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

                <p id="Par40">Otherwise, results of a study in which researchers used electromyography suggest that the muscle activity of infants who are breastfed exclusively renders them less likely to develop dysfunctional muscular patterns that might predispose bottle-fed infants to develop a malocclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>

In short, the mother would prepare meals in both consistencies and allow the child to both be spoon-fed and grab sticks of food concomitantly as they desire, without following a regular pattern. If the child prefers to eat certain types of foods as sticks and others mashed, that would be allowed, i.e., self-feed fruit sticks and then be spoon-fed dinner.

A different researcher will analyze the answers and compare them with further data collected at the 9-month visit, in addition to a 24-h dietary record. These records will be collected during the home visit, by trained researchers. However, as some mothers might not be able to quantify food intake exactly, all participants will also be asked when they introduced a variety of different foods at the 9-month and 12-month visits. Questionnaires to assess adherence to self-feeding, breastfeeding practices, and introduction of complementary foods at 6 months will also be administered at the 9-month and 12-month visits. The rates of adherence will be analyzed. All participants will be included to the final analyses, regardless of having followed the method, since the analyzes will be made by intention-to-treat.</p>
