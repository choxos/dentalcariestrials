                  <p>Volunteers wore palatal appliances containing demineralized enamel blocks and
brushed their teeth and devices with the dentifrices supplied (double-blind,

were obtained for the 3-day period. Significant differences in SH and ΔKHN were
observed among all groups for the 3-day period, but not between 0-275, 275-550,

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, fluoride was the main agent used for the control
of dental caries worldwide, being available to the population through the use of
vehicles of varying concentrations and modes of use. Studies carried out in different
countries indicate the use of fluoride-containing dentifrices as the main responsible
for both the decrease in caries prevalence and the increase in dental
fluorosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>. Among the strategies to decrease fluoride intake from
this source, and therefore minimizing the risk to develop dental fluorosis, the
reduction of fluoride concentration in dentifrices used by young children has been
proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup>. Considering the
controversies surrounding the efficacy of low-fluoride dentifrices when compared to
conventional formulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup>, alternatives to improve their efficacy
have been tested <italic>in vitro</italic>, which include low-pH formulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> and the supplementation with phosphate
salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup>. In order to further
confirm these findings, however, <italic>in situ</italic> tests should be conducted to
verify the dentifrice capacity to reduce mineral loss and/or enhance remineralization
prior to clinical trials, which are more costly and time demanding.</p>
              <p>A variety of <italic>in situ</italic> protocols assessing the remineralizing capacity of
fluoride dentifrices, solutions and gels is described in the literature. Most of the
studies, however, evaluated products containing high fluoride concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>, while others compared low-fluoride products with different
remineralizing agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup> or only with placebo treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup>.
According to recent recommendations, <italic>in situ </italic>protocol designs must
determine dose-response effects in order to attest the efficacy of already existing
formulations, as well as to validate new formulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, when developing and evaluating
low-fluoride dentifrices, it is difficult to select a protocol that fulfills the
above-mentioned recommendations, as existing protocols vary considerably regarding the
length of experimental period (7 to 60 days), substrate (human or bovine enamel),
treatment frequency (2 to 4 times/day), and whether the application is <italic>in
vivo</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Moreover, no protocol has assessed
differences between groups regarding variation in fluoride concentration.</p>
              <p>Since no <italic>in situ </italic>protocol has assessed the dose-response effects of
fluoride dentifrices, especially involving low-fluoride dentifrices, the aim of this
study was to evaluate an <italic>in situ </italic>remineralization model in order to
determine dose-response effects with dentifrices containing low fluoride concentrations
using artificially demineralized bovine enamel.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This study followed a double-blind, crossover protocol, assessing the effect of 4
different treatments (dentifrices containing 0, 275, 550 and 1,100 µg F/g, as NaF),
tested separately for 3 and 7 days. Bovine enamel blocks (3×3 mm,
<italic>n</italic>=330) selected by surface hardness (SH) were artificially
demineralized, and subsequently submitted to post demineralization hardness test
(SH<sub>1</sub>). Ten blocks were also analyzed by polarized light microscopy
prior to the <italic>in situ </italic>phases. Sample size was established at 9
volunteers <italic>per</italic> group to obtain a power of 80% (α=0.05), based on a
previous study conducted with similar research protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>. Considering the possibility of dropouts, 12
volunteers were included in the study. During each experimental phase, volunteers
wore palatal appliances containing 4 demineralized enamel blocks and were randomly
assigned to 1 of the 8 possible treatments. They were instructed to brush their teeth
and the palatal devices with the dentifrices supplied (3 times/day); a fluoride-free
dentifrice was used by the volunteers for 7 days between each experimental phase.
Surface (SH<sub>2</sub>) and cross-sectional hardness were assessed to calculate the
percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SH) and integrated subsurface hardness
(ΔKHN), respectively. Fluoride concentration in enamel was also determined.
Dentifrices and experimental periods were considered as variation factors, and
surface hardness (SH, SH<sub>1</sub> and SH<sub>2</sub>), integrated subsurface
hardness (ΔKHN) and fluoride concentration in enamel (µg F/mm<sup>3</sup>) were
considered as the response variables. The project was reviewed and approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of Univ. Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Brazil
(#2007/02270).</p>

                <title>Dentifrice formulation and fluoride assessment</title>
                <p>Dentifrices used in the study were produced in the laboratory of Pediatric Dentistry
of Araçatuba Dental School (UNESP, Brazil) contained the following components:
titanium dioxide, carboxymethylcellulose, methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, sodium saccharin,
peppermint oil, glycerol, hydrated silica, sodium lauryl sulfate, and water. Sodium
fluoride (NaF, Merck<sup>®</sup>, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the formulations
in order to obtain the concentrations of 275, 550 and 1,100 µg F/g. A dentifrice
without fluoride (placebo) was also prepared.</p>
                <p>Total fluoride (TF) and ionic fluoride (IF) were assessed according to Delbem, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10 </xref></sup>(2002), using an F
ion-specific electrode (Orion 9609 BN; Orion Research Inc, Beverly, MA, USA) coupled

previously calibrated with five standard solutions (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 µg

                <p>Twelve young adults, aged 20-30 years, living in an area with fluoridated drinking
water (0.7 mg F/L) were randomly selected, with no gender distinction. As inclusion
criteria, volunteers should present good general and oral health and normal salivary

included the use of any medicine likely to interfere with salivary secretion, use of
fixed or removable orthodontic appliances, pregnancy or breastfeeding, smoking, or
presence of any systemic illness. Volunteers who showed average mineral gain higher
than 20% using placebo dentifrice (3-day experimental regimen) were also excluded

                <p>Enamel blocks (3×3 mm, <italic>n</italic>=330) were obtained from bovine incisors,
sequentially polished (200 µm) and selected by surface hardness (SH). Artificial
subsurface demineralization was produced according to Queiroz, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21 </xref></sup>(2008) as modified by Spiguel, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup>(2009). Selected blocks
were isolated with acid-resistant varnish, except for the enamel surface (9
mm<sup>2</sup>), and immersed individually in demineralizing solution (1.3
mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> Ca, 0.78 mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> P in 0.05 mol.L<sup>-1</sup>
acetate buffer [pH 5.0]; 0.03 ppm F; 18 mL/block) for 16 hours, at 37ºC. Blocks were
then submitted to post demineralization surface hardness (SH<sub>1</sub>).</p>

                <title><italic>In situ</italic> study protocol and instructions to volunteers</title>
                <p>Volunteers were given information on the study protocol and signed a written,
informed consent prior to the beginning of the study. Palatal appliances should be
used all the time during each experimental phase (including during sleep), and should
be removed only during the main meals. The participants were also instructed not to
use any fluoride products (except fluoridated drinking water) and/or antibacterial
mouthwashes.</p>
                <p>Custom-made acrylic palatal appliances were provided to the volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>, which included 4 demineralized
enamel blocks (two on each side), fixed on the same level of the appliance in order
to minimize plaque accumulation. Each experimental dentifrice was tested separately
for 3 and 7 days, totaling 8 experimental phases. Volunteers were instructed to brush
their natural teeth and the palatal appliances (including the enamel blocks), three
times <italic>per </italic>day, for 1 minute each time, and to rinse their mouth with
tap water. One week before the beginning of the experiment and between treatments,
volunteers used a fluoride-free dentifrice (wash-out).</p>

                <title>Analysis of enamel hardness</title>
                <p>Surface and cross-sectional enamel hardness was measured using a Shimadzu HMV-2000
hardness tester (Knoop diamond, 25 g, 10 s, HMV-2000; Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan) coupled to CAMS-WIN software (Newage Testing Instruments, Southampton, PA,
USA). Five impressions were performed in the central region of each block, 100 µm
distant from each other (SH). After artificial enamel demineralization
(SH<sub>1</sub>) and after the <italic>in situ</italic> experimental
remineralization (SH<sub>2</sub>), five impressions 100 µm distant from each other
and from the initial impressions (SH) were performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p>Blocks were then longitudinally sectioned into two halves through the central part of
the exposed enamel. One half was embedded in acrylic resin and sequentially polished.
For cross-sectional hardness measurements, 3 sequences of 8 impressions were
performed at distances 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 220, and 330 µm from the external
surface of enamel; one sequence was performed in the central region of the block and
the other two sequences were done on each side (100 µm) of the first sequence. The
mean of the three measurements was calculated for each distance. The integrated area
under the curve (cross-sectional hardness profiles into the enamel), using hardness
values (KHN), was calculated by the trapezoidal rule (GraphPad Prism, version 3.02,
San Diego, CA, USA) for each depth (µm) from the lesion to sound enamel. This value
was subtracted from the integrated area of sound enamel to obtain the integrated area
of subsurface regions in enamel, which was named integrated loss of subsurface
hardness (DKHN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Lesion depth analysis</title>
                <p>Sections of 600 µm thick were obtained from demineralized blocks not submitted to the
<italic>in situ</italic> protocol (<italic>n</italic>=10, control) using a diamond
disk, and subsequently ground and polished (Phoenix Beta-Vector; Buehler, Lake Bluff,
IL, USA) resulting in slices 100 µm thick. Enamel sections were mounted on slides in
deionized/distilled water, covered with a coverslip and sealed with ethelan resin.
Sections were then examined by polarized light microscopy (Axiophot; Zeiss DSM-940 A,
Oberkochen, Germany) at 400x magnification. Three areas in the central region of the
slices were analyzed to verify the presence and thickness of the superficial enamel

                <p>Enamel biopsy was performed based on the study by Weatherell, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28 </xref></sup>(1985) as modified by Alves, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> (2007). Enamel blocks
(1.5×1.5 mm) were obtained from the halves not embedded for cross-sectional analysis,
fixed to a handpiece mandrel, coupled to a microscope attached to a digital
micrometer (Pantec, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) so that biopsy depth could be measured.
Self-adhesive polishing discs (13 mm in diameter), 400 grit silicon carbide paper
(Buehler Ltd, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) were fixed to the bottom of polystyrene crystal
tubes (J-10, Injeplast, São Paulo, SP, Brazil), to remove a 50 µm enamel layer. To
each tube, 0.5 mol.L<sup>-1</sup> HCl (0.5 mL) was added, which were constantly
shaken for 30 minutes. Following, 0.5 mol.L<sup>-1 </sup>NaOH (0.5 mL) was
added<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p>Samples were buffered with TISAB III (Orion Research Inc, Beverly, MA, USA) and
fluoride was analyzed using a fluoride ion-selective electrode (9409, Orion Research
Inc, Beverly, MA, USA) and a reference microelectrode (Analyser, São Paulo, SP,
Brazil), both connected to an ion analyzer (Orion 720A<sup>+</sup>). Five standard
solutions (0.045 to 0.720 µg F/mL), containing HCl, NaOH and TISAB III at the same
ratios as the samples were used to calibrate the electrode. The results are expressed
as µg/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

Experimental dentifrices and regimen periods (3 and 7 days) were considered as

fluoride concentration were considered as variables. Data passed normality
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and homocedasticity (Cochran) tests, and were submitted to 2-way
ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test. The relationships between enamel fluoride
concentrations and SH<sub>2</sub> and ΔKHN were verified by Pearson's correlation
coefficient. Post hoc power analysis was calculated for SH<sub>2</sub> and ΔKHN
between groups that did not reach significant differences.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The supersaturation of saliva with respect to the dental mineral indicates that enamel
remineralization naturally occurs when salivary pH is above 5.5, and even traces of
fluoride make saliva highly supersaturated with respect to fluorhydroxyapatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>in situ</italic>
protocols assessing the remineralizing effects of fluoridated products should allow for
the remineralization process to occur by the action of saliva when associated to a
placebo treatment, indicating that it primarily occurs through the effects of intraoral
calcium and phosphate ions. Some <italic>in situ</italic> models have shown mineral loss
after a placebo treatment, thereby hindering observation of the effects of salivary ions
in the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. Other protocols have
not included a placebo group, making it impossible to verify whether the resulting
effects were due to the salivary action or the treatment itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>. The present 3-day experimental model,
on the other hand, promoted a mineral gain of 18.4% in the placebo group when compared
to baseline values. This result was 1.5 times higher (28.2%) when the same dentifrice
was used for 7 days, indicating that the protocol fulfilled the above-mentioned
requirement.</p>
              <p>In the present study, only volunteers with mineral gain lower than 20% after using a
placebo dentifrice for a 3-day period were selected. This selection criterion was
adopted so that the capacity of fluoride products in enhancing remineralization in
difficult situations (by enrolling less responsive subjects) could be evaluated, besides
minimizing variability among volunteers. When a remineralizing agent is used in the
clinical situation, it is expected that its action occurs within the shortest length of
time possible. However, as <italic>in vivo</italic> demineralization and
remineralization processes depend on multiple factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>, the accurate determination of the length of time for
<italic>in situ </italic>protocols becomes a difficult task. In this sense, some
important variables should be considered before determining the experimental period of
an <italic>in situ</italic> study. Among these factors, the type of substrate and the
depth of the artificial caries lesion seem to be the most important.</p>
              <p>Bovine enamel has a higher reactivity and porosity, which leads to faster
remineralization when compared to human enamel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. It has been shown that human enamel remineralization
<italic>in situ </italic>was accomplished in nine days, exhibiting a higher
remineralization rate on the first days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>. In the present study,
the demineralized areas associated to the use of the 1,100 µg F/g dentifrice were 9.4
and 3.5 times lower than those verified after using the placebo and the 550 µg F/g
dentifrices, respectively, in the 3-day experimental model. For the 7-day experimental
period, an increase in mineral gain around 30% was observed for the placebo group,
whereas no changes were verified after using the 1,100 µg F/g dentifrice, in comparison
to groups treated with the same dentifrices for 3 days. Moreover, the remineralization
results (SH<sub>2</sub> and ΔKHN) were directly related to enamel fluoride
concentrations, but longer exposure to fluoride-containing dentifrice did not increase
fluoride concentration in enamel. Also, the correlation coefficients observed between
enamel fluoride concentrations and SH<sub>2</sub> and ΔKHN were higher for the 3-day
experimental protocol when compared to 7-day one. Taking the considerations above into
account, it becomes clear that longer experimental designs may reduce the model capacity
to verify fluoride dose-response effects. This is particularly critical in study
protocols using 14- to 60-day experimental periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>As for the substrate, the depth of enamel demineralization may also interfere with
remineralization time; however, few studies have considered the depth of the
demineralized area in their protocols, which ranged from 30.0 to 77.3 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>. The mean depth of artificial demineralization in the present study was
47.7 µm, resembling a subsurface lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1A</xref>). It is known that the remineralization process is slower in deep lesions
(±100 µm) due to a longer distance for ion diffusion when compared to that seen in the
present study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. The present results
indicate that the peak remineralization capacity of the 1,100 µg F/g dentifrice was
achieved in only 3 days, with no significant difference between the results obtained 7
days after using the same dentifrice. Considering that the placebo, 275 and 550 µg F/g
dentifrices tested for 7 days achieved SH<sub>2</sub> and ΔKHN values similar to those
found for the 275, 550 and 1,100 µg F/g dentifrice, respectively, it can be assumed that
all treatment groups could achieve the same values as those obtained for the 1,100 µg
F/g dentifrice had the experimental protocol been longer. This assumption is also
supported by the analysis of the polarized light microscopy images, which show a clear
reduction in the demineralized areas influenced by both the fluoride concentration in
dentifrices and the time of the experimental protocol. Therefore, according to the
present protocol, longer experimental periods would not allow for the assessment of the
actual effects of the fluoride concentrations in the dentifrices.</p>
              <p>Another factor allowing for fast remineralization in the 3-day protocol, after using the
1,100 µg F/g dentifrice was the type of lesion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1A</xref> shows a demineralized area under a more mineralized surface zone (red) than
the lesion body (deeper zone); the surface zone, however, is extremely less mineralized
than sound enamel (yellow). This type of lesion presents a faster remineralization rate
due to the higher number and diameter of the lesion pores, being suitable for comparing
the efficacy of different remineralizing regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>In summary, it can be concluded that the present <italic>in situ</italic>
remineralization model was able to verify dose-response effects with both 3- and 7-day
experimental periods. However, as the 3-day protocol resulted in higher correlation
coefficients between fluoride concentration in the dentifrice and SH<sub>2</sub> and
ΔKHN, and considering that the peak remineralization capacity of the conventional
dentifrice formulation (1,100 µg F/g) was achieved in 3 days, this experimental period
could be used in future studies assessing the effects of new dentifrice formulations,
especially at low-fluoride concentrations. It is important to highlight that in addition
to the ability to determine dose-response effects, this short-term experimental design
may lead to better volunteer compliance, which would result in more reliable and
standardized results.</p>
