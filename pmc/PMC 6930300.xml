                <p id="Par1">Human microbiomes are predicted to assemble in a reproducible and ordered manner yet there is limited knowledge on the development of the complex bacterial communities that constitute the oral microbiome. The oral microbiome plays major roles in many oral diseases including early childhood caries (ECC), which afflicts up to 70% of children in some countries. Saliva contains oral bacteria that are indicative of the whole oral microbiome and may have the ability to reflect the dysbiosis in supragingival plaque communities that initiates the clinical manifestations of ECC. The aim of this study was to determine the assembly of the oral microbiome during the first four years of life and compare it with the clinical development of ECC. The oral microbiomes of 134 children enrolled in a birth cohort study were determined at six ages between two months and four years-of-age and their motherâs oral microbiome was determined at a single time point. We identified and quantified 356 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria in saliva by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S RNA genes. Bacterial alpha diversity increased from a mean of 31 OTUs in the saliva of infants at 1.9 months-of-age to 84 OTUs at 39 months-of-age. The oral microbiome showed a distinct shift in composition as the children matured. The microbiome data were compared with the clinical development of ECC in the cohort at 39, 48, and 60 months-of-age as determined by ICDAS-II assessment. <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> was the most discriminatory oral bacterial species between health and current disease, with an increased abundance in disease. Overall our study demonstrates an ordered temporal development of the oral microbiome, describes a limited core oral microbiome and indicates that saliva testing of infants may help predict ECC risk.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is a complex, multifaceted disease involving interactions between the oral microbiota, host susceptibility at the tooth, mouth and person level, and environmental factors, especially behaviours relating to early feeding practices, ingestion of free sugars and oral hygiene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. ECC is defined as the presence of one or more decayed (non-cavitated or cavitated lesions), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) in any primary tooth in a child under the age of six years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Australian children at four years of age have an average decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft) score of 1.94<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, this score masks the true pattern and burden of disease as 60% of those examined were caries free. Additionally, the burden of disease associated with ECC is disproportionately borne by children from vulnerable and disadvantaged families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Although largely preventable ECC can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages. Cavitation is a late stage of the disease process that initially manifests as a change in the species composition of the supragingival plaque microbiota from the commensal plaque biofilm community to a dysbiotic community that is dominated by acidogenic and aciduric species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although <italic>S. mutans</italic> and to a lesser degree <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> have historically been linked to dental caries initiation recent microbiome-based studies have implicated a much wider range of other acidogenic and aciduric bacterial species, including other streptococci, <italic>Actinomyces</italic> spp. and bifidobacteria such as <italic>Scardovia wiggsiae</italic> with disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The abundance of a number of these species in supragingival plaque has been associated with caries activity in cross-sectional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Detection of the change in composition of the supragingival plaque microbiota is therefore a method to detect ECC-risk prior to clinical manifestation of caries and offers the opportunity to treat caries at its earliest stages preventing irreversible cavitation.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The bacterial aetiology of ECC is further complicated by the fact that bacteria are colonising the childâs oral cavity at a time when teeth are erupting and are vulnerable to demineralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We currently have limited information on the timing of the colonisation of human oral cavity by bacteria and the development of the oral microbiome in infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Saliva is an easily obtained bodily fluid that contains a significant number of detectable oral bacterial species that have the potential to act as biomarkers for the bacterial dysbiosis in supragingival plaque that leads to clinical caries manifestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The bacterial composition of saliva, whilst over representing those bacteria present on the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, especially the tongue and buccal epithelium, has been routinely used to describe the oral microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. By better understanding how the oral microbiome develops and behaves over time in infants in health and disease we may be able to identify children at highest risk of disease and develop interventions at critical time-points to more effectively prevent disease development and progression.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In this study we used a longitudinal cohort study model to characterise the oral microbiomes of 134 children at six time-points from two months-of-age to four years-of-age, along with the microbiomes of their mothers. The onset and progression of ECC in these children was determined up to five years-of-age. The oral microbiome was then compared with clinical outcomes.</p>

                <title>VicGen cohort study</title>
                <p id="Par6">The VicGen longitudinal cohort study of infants/children was established in 2008 to follow the natural history and examine the causative factors of Early Childhood Caries (ECC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Participants were recruited through their mother from Maternal and Child Health Centres in six local government areas in Victoria, Australia. Clinical oral examinations, questionnaires and collection of saliva from the children were conducted at seven mean ages (Â± standard deviation) - 1.9âÂ±â0.8, 7.7âÂ±â1.3, 13.2âÂ±â1.2, 19.7âÂ±â2.0, 39.0âÂ±â3.2, 48.6âÂ±â1.6 and 60âÂ±â1.8 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par7">Ethics approval to conduct this study was provided by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 0722543 and HREC 1137124) and the study was approved by the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (Ref: 2008/202). All research described in this manuscript was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, and informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parent or legal guardian.</p>
                <p id="Par8">In the current nested study 134 child/mother dyads from the VicGen cohort had their saliva samples sequenced for microbiomic determination. They were selected on the basis of disease development and included a suitable number of healthy controls. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the full cohort of 259 child/mother dyads who completed the larger VicGen study with those 134 in this analysis. The 134 child/mother dyads were similar on all parameters except the larger VicGen group had a lower representation of metropolitan dwellers and as a consequence fewer lived in fluoridated areas at the beginning of the cohort study (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par9">Modified International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II) criteria were used for caries assessment. ICDAS II was developed for clinical use in caries management and epidemiology, as the measure correlates the clinical appearance of a lesion with its histological depth or severity. ICDAS II is validated for use with children, comparable to standard criteria in epidemiological surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and has acceptable validity and reproducibility for all codes when used with primary molar teeth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The need to collect data in the field rather than a dental clinic setting precluded the use of compressed air, therefore Code 1 lesions could not be recorded unless they were located in pits or fissures. The caries assessment was conducted by three dental practitioners who had been trained, calibrated and were familiar with the screening methodology before clinical data collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Restorations were given an ICDAS II score of 5, with a total of nine children at the sixth visit and 20 children at the seventh visit having at least one dental restoration. Teeth that were reported to be extracted due to caries were given an ICDAS II score of 6. One child from the sixth visit and one from the seventh visit each had an extraction due to dental caries.</p>

Maternal saliva was collected at the same time as their infantâs second clinical assessment at 7.7 months-of-age. The samples were rapidly frozen at â20âÂ°C, stored and periodically transported to the Melbourne Dental School where they were stored at â80âÂ°C in secure freezers until further analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par11">In total saliva samples from 134 children and their mothers were subjected to microbiomic analyses. The childrenâs saliva was analysed at the first six mean ages - 1.9, 7.7, 13.2, 19.7, 39.0 and 48.6 months-of-age. Total DNA was extracted from saliva samples for each time-point collected.

                <p id="Par12">Methods for DNA extraction from saliva were based on the NIH Human Microbiome Project Manual of Procedures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). Total DNA was extracted from saliva using PowerLyzerÂ® PowerSoilÂ® DNA Isolation Kits (Qiagen). The manufacturerâs âVacuum Protocolâ instructions were followed with minor modifications as follows: For a given volume of saliva, the amount of total DNA that could be extracted was much higher for adults than for children. Therefore, for DNA extraction up to 400âÎ¼L of saliva from children and 200âÎ¼L of saliva from adults was added to the bead tubes. Bead Solution was then added to a final volume of 750âÎ¼L, as well as 4âÎ¼L of 100âmM RNase A (Sigma Aldrich) to eliminate RNA. Samples were lysed using a Precellys 24 Homogeniser (Bertin Technologies), at speed 5000 for 45 s. Detergent-containing Solution-C1 was added post-homogenisation to avoid excessive foaming and mixed by inversion. Samples were then incubated for 5 min at room temperature, to allow time for RNA digestion, before performing the inhibitor removal, binding and washing steps as specified in the Mo Bio Laboratories protocol. DNA was eluted using 40âÎ¼L of 2âmM Tris buffer at pH 8, pre-heated to 70âÂ°C. Purified DNA was stored at â80âÂ°C.</p>

Experimental controls consistently showed that the Platinum<sup>Â®</sup> PCR SuperMix High Fidelity specified in the protocol, failed to amplify <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic> DNA, so Q5<sup>Â®</sup> Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Genesearch) was substituted. PCRs were performed using a 50âÎ¼L reaction volume containing 6 ng of total DNA as template (consisting of ~3 ng bacterial DNA), 1X Q5 reaction buffer, 0.3âÎ¼M PAGE-purified custom barcoded primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.2âmM dNTPs (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 unit of Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase. Reactions were held at 98âÂ°C for 3 min to denature the DNA, followed by 17 cycles of amplification at 98 âÂ°C for 10 s, 48âÂ°C for 10 s, and 72âÂ°C for 15 s. The sequences of the 62 barcoded forward-primers and the single reverse-primer used in this study are shown in the Table of Primers (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

The Galaxy/GVL 4.1.0 workbench and FROGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> was used for filtering and clustering of sequences, essentially as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

The multivariate longitudinal analyses were conducted as follows: OTU count table were transformed as relative proportions using Total Sum Scaling, followed by Centered Log Ratio transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Principal Component Analysis was conducted using the mixOmics R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Because of uneven sampling on each individual infant, time trajectories for each OTU and each infant were modelled using smoothing splines with smoothing parameter 0.4.

For bacterial biomarker identification, we applied sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> where we considered specific time points of interest (e.g 39 and 48.6 months-of-age) to discriminate ECC as defined as one or more ICDAS II score of 2 or above versus healthy.</p>

                <title>Temporal development of the oral microbiome</title>
                <p id="Par18">Over time there was an increase in the mean number of bacterial OTUs in the saliva of infants. Children at 1.9 months-of-age had a low bacterial diversity in their saliva with an average of 31âÂ±â11 OTUs. The bacterial diversity increased over time to reach an average of 84âÂ±â16 OTUs at 39 months-of-age then remained stable until 48.6 months-of-age (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mothers of these children had an average of 124âÂ±â25 OTUs in saliva. Principal component analysis of the temporal development of the oral microbiome showed a distinct shift in the composition of the microbiome over time (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To aid in our understanding of how the oral microbiome develops we defined a âcore oral microbiomeâ as containing all taxa that had a 90% or higher prevalence at one or more time-points. At 1.9 months-of-age only seven bacterial OTUs, <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> group (100%), <italic>Gemella haemolysans</italic> (100%), <italic>Streptococcus salivarius</italic> group (98%)<italic>, Rothia mucilaginosa</italic> (93%), <italic>Staphylococcus caprae</italic> (93%), <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> (92%) and <italic>Campylobacter concisus</italic> (92%) were found in above 90% of the child saliva samples (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At 7.7 months-of-age the number of species detected in the saliva of 90% or more of the cohort had increased to 14. This included six of the seven previous species with only <italic>Staphylococcus caprae</italic> decreasing to below 90% prevalence. At 13.2 months-of-age the core microbiome of saliva had increased to 28 species and by 19.7 months-of-age it was 32 species (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The total number of species in the core microbiome then remained relatively stable until 48.6 months-of-age, although the composition varied. The mothers had a distinct oral microbiome from the children (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) with a core microbiome of 54 species, of which 32 of the 40 species listed in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> were present. Notable additions to the core microbiome of the adults compared with the children included five species of <italic>Prevotella</italic> (<italic>P. denticola, P. salivae, P. pallens, P. oris</italic> and <italic>P. nigrescens</italic>), <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>T. socranskii</italic>.

                <title>Disease development in the cohort</title>
                <p id="Par21">All infants examined in this study had a healthy dentition up to a mean age of 19.7 months. At the following clinical assessment at 39 months-of-age, 12 children had cavitation, as defined by having at least one ICDAS II score of 3 or higher. By a mean of 48.6 months-of-age a total of 45 children had clinically detectable cavitation, with 33 of those children developing cavities between 39 and 48.6 months-of-age. By a mean of five years-of-age a total of 65 of the 259 children had cavities with 20 children developing enamel cavities between 48.6 and 60 months-of-age. Using a more sensitive measure of an ICDAS II score of 2, which is a distinct visual change in enamel, as a determination of clinically detectable ECC, 106 of the 259 (41%) children had disease at five years-of-age.</p>
                <p id="Par22">As would be expected the severity of ECC varied across those 65 children with disease. To quantify this variability an ECC severity score was developed by multiplying the number of teeth affected in a child by their ICDAS II score and then summing them. Children who first had ECC detected at 39 months-of-age had a mean ECC severity score of 20.5âÂ±â11.4 with a median of 17.0 at 60 months-of-age. Children who first had ECC detected at 48.6 months-of-age, had a mean ECC severity score of 17.3âÂ±â9.0 with a median of 15.0 at 60 months-of-age. This indicates that similar disease outcomes at 60 months-of-age were obtained for children developing ECC between 39 and 48.6 months-of-age.

                <p id="Par25">As our data indicated that <italic>S. mutans</italic> was the most discriminatory taxa for the prediction of present and future clinical disease we focussed on this species. Only 24% of infants had detectable levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in their saliva at 1.9 months-of-age. Interestingly, this prevalence decreased to 17% at 7.7 months-of-age before increasing to 25% at 13.2 months-of-age, 42% at 19.7 months-of-age and 58% at 39 months-of-age. The prevalence of S. mutans then decreased slightly to 51% at 48.6 months-of-age. Nine children had no detectable <italic>S. mutans</italic> at any time-point up to and including the 48.6 month sample and eight of these children remained healthy with a single child developing detectable disease at 60 months-of-age.</p>

There was no significant difference in the abundance of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in the saliva of the mothers whose children remained healthy and those who developed clinical signs of disease at 39, 48.6 or 60 months-of-age (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>S. mutans</italic> levels in the saliva of children at 1.9, 7.7 and 13.2 months-of-age were not significantly different in children who remained healthy compared with children who developed clinical ECC during the study (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8BâD</xref>). In contrast at 19.7 months-of-age salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> were significantly elevated in children who developed ECC at 39 (pâ=â0.017) and 48.6 (pâ=â0.015) months-of-age, but not children who developed disease at 60 months-of-age, compared with the stay healthy group. (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). At 39 months-of-age salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> were significantly elevated in children who first had ECC clinically detected at 39 (pâ=â0.000) and 48.6 (pâ=â0.000) months-of-age, but not those children who were first diagnosed at 60 months-of-age (pâ=â0.073), relative to the stay healthy group (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8F</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par27">There is currently only very limited information available regarding the development of the oral microbiome in the crucial first years of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This is the first study to characterise the oral microbiomes of over 100 children at six time points from near birth to four years-of-age. There was a rapid colonisation of the oral cavity by a limited number of early colonising bacterial taxa over the first two years of life, demonstrating that this is a crucial age for the ordered development of the oral microbiome. The timing of colonisation and bacterial community development may be affected by a range of environmental factors including the microbiome of their mother, diet, health and antibiotic intake, and may have implications for the normal development of the oral microbiota and disease risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Defining a core oral microbiome as being made up of species that were detected in at least 90% of the children in the cohort, regardless of the abundance of the bacterium, enabled the colonisation pattern of the oral cavity to be determined. The core oral microbiome increased five-fold between approximately two and 39 months-of-age with the initial core microbiome mainly composed of species that adhere to and colonise mucosal epithelial surfaces such as <italic>R. mucilaginosa</italic>, <italic>G. haemolysans</italic> and the <italic>S. salivarius</italic> and <italic>S. mitis</italic> groups. This is to be expected given the absence of teeth in the oral cavity of two-month-old infants. The emergence of hard non-shedding tooth surfaces and dietary changes creating new niches are likely to be responsible for the rapid expansion of the core saliva microbiome. The development of the bacterial biofilm communities that comprise plaque has been shown to proceed in an ordered manner with particular taxa fulfilling specific ecological roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Colonisation times may therefore affect normal plaque development, and possibly susceptibility to disease.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The <italic>S. mitis</italic> group and <italic>G. haemolysans</italic> were the two most abundant taxa in saliva in the first four years of life and had colonised all children by two months-of-age, demonstrating the early colonisation of the oral cavity by these species prior to tooth eruption. The <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> group are widely regarded as commensal species that are associated with oral health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This group of species has a high degree of similarity at the genetic and physiological level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and contains species including <italic>S. mitis</italic>, <italic>S. oralis</italic>, <italic>S. pneumoniae, S. peroris</italic> and <italic>S. dentisani</italic> that are inconsistently classified and difficult to differentiate using the V4 region of the 16s RNA gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The use of the V4 region in this study is therefore likely to lead to an underestimation of the total biodiversity within the oral microbiome. The predominance of the <italic>S. mitis</italic> group reduced over time as more bacterial species colonised the oral cavity. At four years-of-age both species were twice as abundant in the saliva of children compared with adults. This is consistent with the study of Dzidic <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> who found that <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. comprised approximately 80% of the saliva microbiome at three months-of-age declining to around 60% by 7 years-of-age and <italic>Gemella</italic> spp. increased from approximately 6% to 8% over the same time. Sulyanto <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> also found that the <italic>S. mitis</italic> group along with <italic>G. haemolysans, R. mucilaginosa</italic> and the <italic>S. salivarius</italic> group were the most abundant taxa in toddlers and infants up to one year of age.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In the majority of cases the prevalence of core microbiome taxa increased with age. Unusually the prevalence of <italic>S. caprae</italic> decreased over time. This bacterium is regarded as a commensal of human skin and its prevalence at early time-points may reflect contamination of the saliva by contact with the infantâs or motherâs skin, alternatively this species may colonise the oral cavity early in life before being displaced. Three other species <italic>Bergeyella</italic> sp. oral taxon 931, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> sp. oral taxon 221 and <italic>Sneathia sanguinegens</italic> all increased in prevalence to 13.2 months-of-age and then decreased. A few species such as <italic>Tannerella</italic> sp. oral taxon 286, <italic>L. shahii</italic> and <italic>C. morbi</italic> increased in prevalence relatively slowly, becoming components of the core oral microbiome at 39 months-of-age. However, colonisation of the oral cavity by new species still occurs well after four years-of-age as their mothersâ saliva contained many more species and had a distinctly different composition.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In this observed cohort at a mean age of five years 105 of the 259 children in the cohort (41%) had early clinical signs of ECC as determined by an ICDAS II score of 2 or above and 65 of the children (25%) had enamel caries with cavitation, as defined as one or more teeth with an ICDAS II score of 3 or above. This level of disease is similar to that seen in comparable populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, few epidemiological studies have been conducted with children under five years-of-age so it is difficult to generalise amongst populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. ECC is a disease that is detected at varying times and progresses at different rates in individuals. As shown in this study where twelve children (4.6%) showed the first clinical evidence of disease at the 39 month examination, 33 (12.7%) showed the first clinical evidence of disease at the 48.6 month examination and 20 (7.7%) at the five year examination. As could be expected children who first displayed the clinical signs of ECC at 39 months-of-age had more advanced or widespread disease at 60 months-of-age than children who did not display clinical disease until the later time-points as determined using a cumulative ICDAS II score.</p>
              <p id="Par32">ECC begins as a change in the bacterial species composition of the plaque biofilm at specific sites in the oral cavity prior to the subsurface demineralisation of enamel and clinical symptoms of disease. Detection of the change in composition of the supragingival plaque microbiota may therefore be a way to detect ECC prior to clinical manifestation of disease and offers the opportunity to intervene to manage the disease process at its earliest stages and prevent irreversible cavitation. The abundance of a number of bacterial species in supragingival plaque has been associated with caries activity in cross sectional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In the present study we have shown that there was a shift in the composition of the oral microbiome of children who had clinically detectable disease compared with those who were healthy at both 39 and 48.6 months-of-age. However, the magnitude of the shift was insufficient to adequately differentiate between clinical health and disease at an individual level. The most discriminatory species identified to be associated with ECC at both ages was <italic>S. mutans</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">A number of studies have investigated the potential for the oral microbiome to predict future disease. In a recent cohort study the abundance of <italic>Streptococcus cristatus</italic> in saliva was significantly higher at both 3 and 24 months-of-age in children who had caries at 9 years-of-age compared with those who were caries free<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Sampling children at two time-points over a three-year period Holgerson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> determined that apart from higher levels of lactobacilli, the bacterial composition of saliva at 3 months-of-age was unrelated to caries development at three years-of-age. The occurrence of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. in our cohort was universally low with usually only 2â5 children having detectable levels at any given time-point and the detection of these species showed no correlation with disease. In a population with a high prevalence of ECC Chaffee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> showed that high maternal levels of <italic>L. casei</italic> and <italic>S. mutans</italic> in saliva were predictive of increased ECC occurrence. However, in the current cohort although all mothers had detectable levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in their saliva the abundance of this species was not predictive of ECC in their children.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Most children are reported to acquire <italic>S. mutans</italic> soon after eruption of the primary teeth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In an American population with very high ECC incidence, 50% of the children in the cohort had detectable <italic>S. mutans</italic> or <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> in their saliva by two years-of-age and ~79% were positive by four years-of-age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In the current study <italic>S. mutans</italic> was detectable in approximately one quarter of the cohort at 1.9 months-of-age, well before the eruption of teeth, but this prevalence decreased at 7.7 months before returning to a quarter at 13.2 months-of-age. By four years-of-age half of all children had detectable <italic>S. mutans</italic> in their saliva. This pattern of colonisation may indicate early inoculation from their mother or other sources followed by a failure to establish well and proliferate in some children until later in life.</p>
              <p id="Par35">At 39 months-of-age <italic>S. mutans</italic>, <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and <italic>V. parvula</italic> levels in the saliva of children who developed disease at 48.6 months-of-age were all elevated compared with those that remained healthy. Salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> levels were also significantly elevated at 19.7, 39 and 48.6 months-of-age in healthy children who had clinically detectable ECC at the following examination compared with children who remained healthy. Salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> levels also remained elevated during active disease. It is likely therefore that salivary levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic>, as well as others including <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and <italic>V. parvula</italic>, are a useful prognostic biomarker for imminent enamel demineralisation in children from 18 months to four years-of-age. Although this association has been shown previously the majority of studies specifically targeted S. mutans using PCR or culture, were cross sectional or both<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Our study using a prospective cohort study design and a relatively unbiased, open end methodology was able to examine the associations of the majority of bacterial species in saliva with disease over time. Elevated levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic>, <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> and <italic>V. parvula</italic> in saliva is likely to be a surrogate marker for frequent dietary carbohydrate intake in children. This intake results in dysbiosis of the microbial community leading to increases in acidogenic and aciduric bacteria in supragingival plaque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par36">In conclusion the oral microbiome shows an ordered ecological succession during the first four years of life and the bacterial composition of saliva and in particular the abundance of certain species may have potential as biomarkers for ECC.</p>
