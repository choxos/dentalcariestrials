                  <p id="Par1">To compare the survival and clinical performance of implants placed in sites previously augmented with autogenous bone grafts covered by either a platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane (PRF group) or a standard procedure (gold standard) involving coverage of the autogenous bone graft with deproteinised bovine bone mineral and a resorbable collagen membrane (control group).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A total of 27 partially edentulous patients (test <italic>n</italic> = 14, control <italic>n</italic> = 13) with indication for staged lateral bone block augmentation and dental implant placement were included. Twenty-four months after crown placement (range: 14–32 months), patients were recalled for a final clinical and radiographic follow-up. Outcome measures were implant survival, implant crown survival, clinical parameters of the implant, peri-implant marginal bone level, marginal bone level of adjacent tooth surfaces, biological and technical complications and patient-related outcome measures.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Two implants were lost in the control group (85% survival rate); none were lost in the PRF group (100% survival rate). None of the 26 initially placed implant crowns were lost, but one implant and therefore one implant crown were lost after 20 months. Consequently, the definitive implant crown survival was 92% (95% confidence interval (CI): 73–110%) in the control group and 100% in the PRF group. No statistical difference in implant survival rate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.13) or implant crown survival was seen between the groups (<italic>p</italic> = 0.28). The mean marginal bone level at the follow-up was 0.26 mm (95% CI: 0.01–0.50 mm) in the PRF group and 0.68 mm (95% CI: 0.41–0.96 mm) in the control group. The difference between the groups was − 0.43 mm (95% CI: − 0.80 to − 0.05 mm, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), which was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Both groups demonstrated similar healthy peri-implant soft tissue values at the final follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, the findings suggest that the methodology of the PRF and the control group approach can both be used for bone augmentation with a similar outcome. A significant, but clinically irrelevant, higher peri-implant marginal bone level was registered in the PRF group than in the control group. Patients in both groups were highly satisfied with the treatment.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">Implant-supported single crowns are characterised by high long-term survival and few biological and technical complications, which typically includes peri-implant marginal bone loss, screw-loosening and fracture of veneering material complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To achieve a successful treatment outcome, the implants must be inserted in sufficient bone volume of an adequate quality to obtain primary stability enabling establishment of osseointegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In many patients, this can be challenging due to extensive atrophy of the alveolar ridge after tooth loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] which compromises implant placement in a correct anatomical position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In cases where extensive reduction of the alveolar bone causes inability to achieve primary stability of the implant, the gold standard for lateral ridge augmentation involves an autogenous bone graft harvested from an intraoral donor site covered by a deproteinised bovine bone mineral (DBBM) and a resorbable collagen barrier membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The survival of implants placed in lateral augmented autogenous bone is high and comparable to that of implants placed in native bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the use of a barrier membrane may increase the risk of bone graft exposure due to soft tissue dehiscences, thereby compromising the success of the bone augmentation procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a platelet concentrate derived from a blood sample provided by the patient and produced without any anticoagulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In vitro studies have demonstrated a positive effect of the use of PRF on cell proliferation, migration and adhesion in addition to anti-inflammatory and angiogenetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which may have a beneficial clinical effect in bone augmentation procedures. Furthermore, the ability of PRF to inhibit osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] may reduce bone resorption during the healing period. The PRF matrix can be compressed into a membrane, which has proven to be suitable as a scaffold for periosteal and osteoblastic tissue engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite the shape of a membrane, the PRF membrane does not have the properties of a resorbable barrier membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], due to its fast degradation in the same manner as a natural blood clot (1–2 weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the PRF membrane is not believed to replace a barrier membrane in the classic understanding of guide bone regeneration (GBR), but rather to enhance the healing capacity of the periosteum and inwards to the augmented bone. Based on the positive effect of PRF in clinical and in vitro studies, it may therefore be speculated that adding PRF to a bone augmentation procedure may improve the vitality of the augmented bone, thereby causing accelerated bone remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In other words, dental implants can be inserted into more vital bone compared to the gold standard procedure, which from a clinical point of view is preferred to obtain optimal osseointegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a recently published systematic review on clinical studies, it was concluded that PRF facilitates bone regeneration, although the evidence was moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In oral and maxillofacial surgery, accelerated soft tissue healing has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have presented the results of clinical and radiographic evaluation of implants placed in autogenous bone grafts covered by PRF membranes. Therefore, the purpose of this randomised, controlled clinical trial (RCT) was to compare the survival and clinical performance of implants placed in sites previously augmented with autogenous bone grafts covered by either a PRF membrane (PRF group) or a standard procedure (gold standard) involving coverage of the autogenous bone graft using a DBBM and a resorbable collagen membrane (control group). Our null hypothesis was that no difference between the test (PRF group) and the control group would exist.</p>

Twenty months after placement of the implant-supported crown, one implant (first premolar, regular platform (4.3 mm), length: 13 mm) was lost due to failed osseointegration. No periodontitis or peri-implant marginal bone resorption was obvious at the time of implant removal. A second implant (central incisor, narrow platform (3.75 mm)) was lost during the placement of the final implant crown. For unknown reasons, a minimal rotation of the implant crown occurred several times when the abutment screw was torqued. In the phase of counter-torqueing the abutment screw, the implant loosened and was finally lost. Three months after the implants were lost, sufficient alveolar bone was still present in both patients and new implants were installed without further complications. Consequently, 11 out of 13 implants (85%, 95% CI: 62–104%) survived in the control group, and 14 out of 14 implants survived in the PRF group (100%).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par66">The present study focused on clinical and radiographic characteristics of staged implants placed in autogenous bone grafts covered by either a PRF membrane (PRF group) or a standard procedure (gold standard) involving coverage of the autogenous bone graft using a deproteinised bovine bone mineral and a resorbable collagen membrane (control group).</p>
              <p id="Par67">The PRF group demonstrated a high implant survival; however, two out of 13 implants were lost in the control group. The difference between the groups was non-significant, although implant survival in the control group to some extent differs from that reported in previous studies on survival of implants placed in bone grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One implant (first premolar, regular platform (4.3 mm), length: 13 mm) and the corresponding implant-supported crown were lost 20 months after final crown placement due to failed osseointegration. The reason for the implant loss remains unclear since no preceding biological complications were reported. The fact that the biopsy was taken from a relatively narrow bone block may have compromised the clinical outcome of the implant treatment, although none of the bone blocks were clinically loosened during the biopsy procedure. Harvesting of bone biopsies of larger autogenous bone blocks followed by implant placement has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but no follow-up on implant survival has been reported. Another possible explanation for the loss of the second implant (central incisor, narrow platform (3.75 mm)) were problems with rotation of the ASC abutment in relation to the metal adaptor when tightening the abutment screw at the time of placement of the final crown. While counter-torqueing the abutment screw, the implant loosened and was finally lost. Only original components were used when fabricating the implant-supported crown, and the reason for the minimal rotation remains unclear. The combination of the NobelParallel CC implant launched in 2015 and an abutment with ASC is relatively new and has so far been lined to only few mechanical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], among which rotation of the crown when torqueing the abutment screw was not stated. In both patients, a new implant was placed without any need for additional bone augmentation and without further complications. Apart from these biological and mechanical problems, no additional complications were registered.</p>
              <p id="Par68">Assessment of PD and BOP revealed that most implants were characterised by healthy peri-implant tissues. The mean PD at implant level was 2.19 mm in the PRF group and 2.13 mm in the control group. Similar findings of long-term clinical outcomes of implants placed in an autogenous bone block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and native bone have previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. All implants were positioned approximately 2.5 mm apically from the buccal gingival margin, which in some patients resulted in placement of the implant top apically to the marginal bone level (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At the final follow-up, both groups demonstrated favourable peri-implant marginal bone levels, although the PRF group revealed a 0.43 mm (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03) higher peri-implant marginal bone level than the control group, meaning that the bone level was higher around the implant for the test group. This difference may be caused by a higher number of incisor implants in the control group (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), since a more pronounced bone resorption rate in the anterior region compared to the posterior region following bone block augmentation has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One patient in the PRF group demonstrated bone resorption around the implant at the abutment operation of more than 1 mm, but the marginal peri-implant bone level of that implant was stable both when the impression was taken and at the final follow-up. In contrast, one patient in the control group demonstrated a stable peri-implant marginal bone level both at the abutment operation and when the impression was taken, but showed a peri-implant marginal bone loss of more than 2 mm at the final follow-up. Consequently, the long-term prognosis of this implant may be compromised. The histological evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] of the biopsies retrieved at implant placement of this patient sample has previously been described. The above-mentioned patients were the only two patients (2/25 patient) in which their bone biopsy was characterized by moderate to heavy inflammation, indicating that the bone resorption and thereby the peri-implant marginal bone level are associated with resolution of the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For both groups, the peri-implant marginal bone level of the implants was comparable to levels reported in previous studies involving implant placement in non-augmented and augmented sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par69">A minor, but statistically significant, radiographic bone loss occurred from baseline to the final follow-up at the neighbouring tooth surfaces in both groups. Moreover, both groups experienced a minor recession of the marginal gingiva from baseline to the final follow-up, but the change was not significant. Recession and the bone level of the neighbouring tooth surfaces to implants placed in autogenous bone grafts have not been assessed previously, but preservation of the marginal bone level of the neighbouring tooth surfaces is important to preserve the vertical position of the papillae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Obviously, recession around the teeth has a clinically and aesthetically adverse effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par70">Some complications were registered in the process from the primary bone augmentation to implant placement, including a loss of one bone block and a minor change of intra- and extraoral sensitivity. Also, at the time of implant placement, simultaneous bone augmentation was necessary due to bone resorption of the primary augmented bone block in two patients (one patient in each group). This finding is consistent with previously described complications after bone block augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and in both patients, no further complications were registered. Despite these observed complications, the rating of the patient questionnaire revealed an overall high satisfaction with treatment at baseline and at the follow-up.</p>
              <p id="Par71">The prospective study design involving randomisation as well as a standardised surgical technique and systematic postoperative follow-up is an important strength of this study. Some weaknesses should also be acknowledged. First, it is important to bear in mind the potential bias associated with taking a biopsy from a relatively narrow bone block on the long-term results for implant treatment. It is possible that the clinical result of losing two implants is associated with the mechanical force applied on the bone block when retrieving the bone biopsy. This should be considered in future scientific work involving bone biopsy from a narrow bone block. Another limitation of the present study is the small sample of participants and the distribution of different recipient sites. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par72">Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, the findings suggest that the methodology of the PRF and the control group approach can both be used for bone augmentation with a similar outcome. A significant, but clinically irrelevant, higher peri-implant marginal bone level was registered in the PRF group than in the control group. Patients in both groups were highly satisfied with the treatment.</p>
