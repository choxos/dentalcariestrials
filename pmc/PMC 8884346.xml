              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and its associated neuromuscular system are the two fundamental components of the temporomandibular system. The American Academy of Orofacial Pain broadly classifies temporomandibular disorders (TMD) into myogenous or muscle-related TMD, and arthrogenous or joint-related TMD.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The clinical features of TMD include pain in the temporomandibular region or muscles of mastication; radiation of pain to the face, behind the eyes, shoulder, neck and/or back; headaches and dizziness; tinnitus or ear-ache; clicking, locking or deviation of jaw; restricted jaw opening; clenching of teeth; and sensitivity of apparently healthy teeth without any oral disease. The most common symptom for which patients seek medical attention is pain in the associating region.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Patients with TMD who do not experience pain, may complain of popping, clicking and crepitus sounds, at the TMJ during joint movement. TMD has a multifactorial etiology. Several theories, including mechanical displacement, biomedical, trauma, osteoarthritis, muscle theory, neuromuscular, psycho-physiological and psychosocial theory, have been proposed to explain the etiology of TMD.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The factors can be classified as predisposing factors, initiating factors and perpetuating. Predisposing factors increases the risk of developing TMD such as genetic factors. Initiating factors like trauma are acute reasons for TMD and at last, perpetuating factors are those factors which delay the healing process. Among perpetuating factors, systemic mineral or vitamin deficiency plays an important role. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with poor muscle strength and poor physical performance. Recently, it has been linked with TMJ Disorders.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Thus, it can be either a predisposing or perpetuating factor in manifestation of TMJ Disorder. Vitamin D supplementation in patients who had deficiency, should improve symptoms of TMD.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The most effective treatment for TMJ issues necessitates a thorough diagnostic examination using research diagnostic criteria/TMD (RDC/TMD). Along with RDC/TMD, an objective method such as evaluating joint vibrations using joint vibration analysis (JVA) can provide to be a very useful and significant diagnostic tool by reducing the chance of individual bias. An ideal therapeutic approach for TMD should focus on ameliorating the main signs and symptoms of this condition. Conservative management for TMD includes medication, occlusal splints, physiotherapy, interventions based on cognitive-behavioral approaches, and self-management strategies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Despite its advantages, evidence for the comparative effectiveness of surgical and conservative intervention to reduce short-term pain in atherogenic TMD is still controversial and inconclusive.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p>
              <p>The definitive treatment for TMD is to reinstate a normal disc-condyle relationship. For this, we usually use centric stabilization splint.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The centric stabilization splint has been reported to resolve myogenic pain, restricted mouth opening, and TMDs. Stabilizing splints help in stabilizing physiologically static and dynamic occlusion, relax the tensed masticatory muscles, and reduce the physiological stress in joint structures. The multimodal treatment plan of combined Vitamin D supplementation and Splint therapy can be implemented in TMD patients to evaluate their response. There is a lack of knowledge in associating Vitamin D with splint therapy in improving the comfort and quality of life in patients exhibiting TMD. The effectiveness of Vitamin D has not yet been established as a supplementary treatment in TMD. Thus, the null hypothesis of this study is that there is no significant difference in combining Vitamin D supplementation along with Splint therapy in patients exhibiting TMD.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The current study aims at giving a diagnosis-based treatment plan to patients with TMD along with Vitamin D deficiency. The purpose of this study is to comparatively evaluate the role/effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation along with stabilization splint therapy in the treatment of patients exhibiting TMDs. The diagnosis was based on both clinical symptoms using RDC/TMD and JVA.</p>

Preoperative blood tests were done for Vitamin D levels. Patients with levels &lt;30 ng/ml and TMD and who come under our inclusion criteria were included in the study [<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>]. For randomization, random number table sequence generated by SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago, III., USA) and was used to allocate patients in study group S + D and control group S. The participants with even number in table were selected for study group S + D and participants with odd number were selected for control group S. For randomization concealment, participants in study group were given Vitamin D supplements in sealed envelope and control group participants were given placebo drug in sealed envelope. Patients who were excluded from study were also given appropriate treatment for TMD.</p>

                  <p>Impression of the maxillary and mandibular arch was taken in irreversible hydrocolloid and were poured in Type III Gypsum product. Bite Registration was done at centric relation using VPS material (CADBITE, IVOCLAR). Models were mounted with dental plaster on HANAU Wide-Vue 183-2 articulator using a HANAU Spring bow and the patient's bite registration record. Wax-up of the splint was done using modeling wax. It was processed in clear heat cure resin. Full coverage splint was fabricated covering the entire arch and it fitted the occlusal and incisal surfaces of maxillary or mandibular teeth. The choice of arch was made on clinical condition like remaining tooth in each arch, periodontal support of each arch and the preference of patient was also considered. The thickness of splint ranged between 2 and 3 mm. Splint was retrieved and polished.</p>

                  <p>Group S + D patients were given Vitamin D tablets 60,000 IU once a week for 8 weeks. Control group S patients were given placebo drug for the same time period. Vitamin D supplements and placebo drugs were packed in a sealed envelope imprinted with a random table number, which were given to the patients by a third person to ensure double-blinding. This procedure was done along with randomization. The study was double-blinded so that neither the researcher nor the participants were aware, whether the patient was in the study group or control group.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This trial was conducted to compare the Vitamin D supplementation and stabilization splint therapy in patients suffering from TMD using both JVA and VAS.</p>
              <p>On comparing the mean of CMO, VAS score, and MMO among two groups, statistically significant difference were observed between delivery of splint and after 1 month of therapy which shows significant improvement. Stiesch-Scholz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] stated that increase in active mouth opening of 8.05 mm causes a significant reduction in pain during splint therapy. Pain reduction in group was evident after 1<sup>st</sup> follow-up where-as in control group, it was seen after 2<sup>nd</sup> follow up. This difference was significant and is because of Vitamin D supplementation. Hence, the null hypothesis was rejected. In this clinical trial, change in CMO was 2.11 mm for S + D group, 2.01 mm for S group, change in MMO was 3.11 mm for S + D group, 2.8 mm for S group.</p>
              <p>Both therapy group patients showed improvement after 1 month of splint delivery and were consistent in both the groups as Stabilization splint therapy was given. Sato <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] stated that Stabilization splint therapy gives 13% more successful results than other splints. Similar studies has been performed by Minakuch <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Suvinen and Reade[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which stated that the stabilization splints have a greater edge above other type of splint design. In this study, stabilization splint therapy was given to both groups keeping in mind the previous quoted literature.</p>
              <p>In both the groups, there was a reduction in TMJ tenderness and muscle pain, resulting in increased MMO. This finding is consistent with study of Block <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in which he concluded that after 1 month of occlusal splint therapy, more than 73% of patients experience symptom remission because of correct condyle-disk relationship which alleviates the symptoms and reduce the muscle tenderness resulting in increased MMO.</p>
              <p>After analyzing the pain score, S + D group showed the best response to therapy. In our study, the VAS Score decreased from 7.61 to 4.06 in group S + D, and 7.67 to 4.61 in group S. Both the group patients showed improvement in VAS Score in 4–8 weeks of therapy with consistent improvement. Best results were seen between 1<sup>st</sup> week and end of 3<sup>rd</sup> month (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in both the groups. Ekberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that muscle myalgia decreases significantly after 6 weeks of duration and so does VAS Score because of reduction in muscular myalgia in specifically inferior lateral pterygoid muscle.</p>
              <p>Both groups of patients demonstrated a downgrading of TE value of the right TMJ. Similar results were found for TE value of left TMJ. Statistically significant differences were found between 1<sup>st</sup> week and end of 3<sup>rd</sup> month signifying improvement and reduction in both the joints vibrations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Stabilization splints has been proved in reducing TMJ vibrations. Garcia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] noted that the vibrations are decreased when mandible is advanced by a mandibular advancement device. Splints causes a forward rotation of the condyle favouring a softer movement during its reduction. In our study, vibrations were decreased in both the groups mostly because of correct condyle-disk relationship permitting softer movements.</p>
              <p>Tenderness in TMJ was relieved in both the groups because of stabilization and distribution of forces. Similar studies were found by Kovaleski and De Boever[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who showed reduction in pain within 2 months of splint therapy.</p>
              <p>After analyzing the Vitamin D levels, best response was seen with S + D group, obviously because of 60,000 IU Vitamin D capsules which were given to all the participants in Group S + D. In our study, the Vitamin D levels increased from 25.11 to 33.56 ng/ml and 24.83 to 26.11 ng/ml in group S + D and Group S respectively which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). On comparing <italic>P</italic> values between 1<sup>st</sup> week and end of 3<sup>rd</sup> month, the difference was significant in group S + D. Park[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] conducted a systematic analysis to see if there was a relation between Vitamin D and osteoarthritis (OA). Vitamin D, according to Park, may help to prevent joint pain. Patients suffering from TMD who have low Vitamin D may benefit from this treatment. Systemic review of Kui <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] culminated that the literature is present to link Vitamin D deficiency and TMD but clinical trials or placebo-controlled trials are not there to prove so. Hence, keeping the above statement in mind, this placebo-controlled clinical trial was planned. The current study had a small sample size, but it was seen that Vitamin D hastens the treatment and gives a quick relief from symptoms of TMD. In future studies, larger sample size and inclusion of more parameters is herewith suggested.</p>
