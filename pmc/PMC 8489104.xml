                  <p id="Par2">Twenty patients with atrophic ridge were treated by alveolar distraction. After completing distractor activation, patients were randomly divided into two equal groups according to administered drug (placebo and Cissus quadrangularis group). After a consolidation period, distractors were removed and implants were inserted. Clinical evaluation was done to assess wound healing, and distractor and implant stability. Histological evaluation was performed at time of implant insertion. Radiographic evaluation was performed to assess bone volume and density after distraction, as well as, density and bone loss around implant.

                  <p id="Par3">Radiographic and histological results showed that bone formation and maturation of study group were faster than that of control group. There was a significant increased bone density in distracted area and around implant in study group than control group. A significant bone loss at end of consolidation period, and around implant at end of the study was reported in control group than study group.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">Cissus quadrangularis administration during the consolidation period is associated with increased osteogenic potential of distracted bone. The histological and radiographic findings of current study proved that Cissus quadrangularis not only enhances rate of new bone formation, but also bone density to withstand the biomechanical requirements of implant placement in a shorter time.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par14">Atrophic alveolar bone is a special challenge which preclude proper implant installation and affect successful long-term results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Decreased alveolar bone height may result in insufficient bone volume for implant installation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In these conditions, various techniques such as onlay bone graft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], guided tissue regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and vertical alveolar distraction osteogenesis (VADO) are recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Main advantage of VADO is increased bone height through new bone formation below distracted segment. Moreover, simultaneous lengthening of associated soft tissues through histogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite its advantages, there are some drawbacks such as fibrous union and non-union of the bone, development of infection, development of psychological problems, with main problem of elongated period for bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Several trials focused on acceleration of bone regeneration to decrease treatment period, improve quality of bone, and minimize risk of bone non-union. For these objectives, adjunctive modalities such as growth factors, hormones, and electrophysiological tools were investigated. Some of these techniques have given good results, but others studies showed no benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">It was reported that different herbal agents could enhance bone healing. Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) is a medicinal plant that has been used in a traditional medicine to heal broken bones and injured ligaments and tendons. Also, it is considered as tonic and analgesic agent. Effect of CQ on acceleration of bone healing and remodeling have been reported to be effective and this is attributed to its capacity to induce metabolism and enhance minerals absorption by osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Accordingly, the aim of this randomized blinded clinical study was to assess osteogenic effect of CQ in VADO for improving bone quality to facilitate treatment in patients requiring implant placement in atrophic posterior mandibular area.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="Sec2">
              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par19">This prospective study, conformed to consort 2010, was done on patients, attending outpatient clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Al-Azhar University, suffered from atrophic posterior mandible and requested to restore missing teeth by implants. The study duration was from March 2017 till May 2020 and ended as planned in the suggested study's protocol. Research methods were illustrated to all patients and they signed an informed consent form before the study. The study was performed according to rules of ethics declared by Helsinki, and ethical committee approval was obtained. This study was retrospectively registered under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrial.gov">www.ClinicalTrial.gov</ext-link> (study no. NCT04669795-17\12\2020).</p>
              <p id="Par20">Preoperative clinical examination was done for all patients to assess their medical status. Also, intraoral clinical examination was performed to evaluate oral hygiene and amount of keratinized mucosa at areas planed for implant placement. Biochemical investigations were done including serum calcium, phosphorous, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Radiographically, orthopantomogram (OPG), and cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) were used to evaluate bone volume available for implant placement.</p>

Also, presented with 2–3 missing teeth at least in posterior area and CBCT showed bone height above inferior alveolar canal (IAC) ranged 8-10mm.While, patients were excluded if they suffered from any disease affect tissue healing, bad oral hygiene or heavy smoking patients.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Patients were classified randomly into two equal groups, using online software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.randomizer.org">https://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>, <bold>Group I</bold>: included 10 patients who were given placebo capsules. While, <bold>Group II</bold>: included 10 patients who were given CQ drug (Hadjod capsules 250 mg, Himalaya Drug company, India, Makali, Bengalure)</p>
              <p id="Par23">All surgeries were achieved under general anesthesia and complete aseptic condition. Before surgery, all patients received prophylactic antibiotic (amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium1gm vial) and antiedematous (Chymotrypsin ampule).</p>
              <p id="Par24">In all patients extraosseous alveolar distractor (Modern Techniques Centre, Cairo, Egypt) was used. An incision was placed on buccocrestal aspect of alveolar ridge and a flap was elevated. A distractor was placed on the ridge to mark screw sites and then removed. Two vertical bone cuts were made in an angulated manner, and a horizontal osteotomy was done 2 mm above IAC. Bone cut was achieved by bur under copious saline irrigation and completed by osteotome. A distractor was stabilized to basal and osteomatized segments with monocortical 2.0 screws. The basal plate was fixed by 2 screws on either side of distraction rode while the transport plate was fixed with one screw on either side of the distraction rode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The device was checked for mobility, and wound was closed primarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Distractor fixation after osteotomy of transport segment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2021_1847_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par25">The distractor was left for 7 days as latency then it was activated at rate of 1mm/ day (at rhythm 0.5 mm twice), till required height was achieved (overcorrection of 2 to 3 mm was done). A consolidation period extended for 3 months. During the consolidation period, patients were prescribed placebo capsules in control group and CQ capsules in study group. The dose was two capsules once /day with meals for 6 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">After the consolidation period, the distractor was removed, and the implants were placed (Super line Systems, Dentium, Co. Ltd, Suwon, South Korea). Implants were loaded 3 months from their installation.</p>
              <p id="Par27">After each surgical stage, clinical evaluation was done to observe signs of infection, wound dehiscence, and function of inferior alveolar nerve. Same preoperative biochemical examinations were repeated immediately after distractor removal.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Histological evaluation was done by biopsy obtained, by a trephine bur, from the implant site during its preparation. The biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution in 0.1M phosphate buffer at room temperature for 24 h. Decalcification was done by 20% formic acid for 3–5 days. Specimens were dehydrated in ethanol series (from 70 to 100%) followed by xylene and paraffin tissue processing then embedded in paraffin blocks. Section with 4µ thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Postoperative radiographic evaluation was performed using OPG. Orthopantomograms were taken immediately after distractor placement, at end of the activation period, at the first and second month of consolidation period, and at end of the consolidation period. Change in bone height was evaluated immediately after distractor placement, at end of the activation period, and at end of the consolidation period. Change in bone density was evaluated using Digora software (digora for windows 2.5 Rev 2 copyright © 1997–2007 soredex system from UK system). On every image, mean gray value of marked region of interest (ROI) was calculated as follow:</p>
              <p id="Par30">A Point A was chosen at center of distracted area and pixel density of that point was evaluated on a scale ranged from 0 to 255. A point B was chosen at the same plane, beside the first area, at the sound bone and its pixel density was evaluated.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Cone beam computerized tomography was taken immediately after implant installation, and 6 months later (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) to evaluate the change in bone density and marginal bone level about the dental implant.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CBCT shows implant after 6 months from its placement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2021_1847_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par32">For assessment of crestal bone level around the implant, a distance from implant apex to a point on the implant where bone contacts the implant was evaluated mesially and distally and average of bone loss round each implant was obtained. For bone density assessment, density of bone was evaluated at crestal, middle, and apical portions of the implant using Bioquant® (G Power, Ver. 3.192 copy right 1992–2014) then average was obtained. Region of interest was chosen and traced. Through counting threshold pixels in each ROI, a single pixel that represents a particular color (white pixels in radiographs) was specified permitting automatic selection of all other pixels in ROI that threshold areas are traced and calculated as a number of pixels that can be counted as a ratio of whole ROI.</p>
              <p id="Par33">On multiplanar screen, navigation was done till exact same view position of dental implant was specified on reformatted panorama and cross-sectional cut. Then, crestal bone loss and bone density about implant was assessed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par46">Decreased alveolar bone height is one of the common problems that limits the outcomes of implant rehabilitation and decrease its success rate. Therefore, bone augmentation is mandatory to gain enough bone and good inter-arch relations for superior prosthetic results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">Different modalities have been developed to augment atrophic ridge as inferior alveolar nerve lateralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], usage of short implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and onlay grafting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, none of these modalities has achieved satisfactory outcomes to fulfill a successful result.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Distraction osteogenesis allows natural synthesis of bone in comparatively short time. This eliminates the need for graft and decreases treatment time. Soft tissues elongation can accompany bone expansion, this beside the minimal risk of infection as compared to bone grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">Cone beam computerized tomography was used for bone evaluation after implant installation only, and it was not used during different distraction phases to avoid artifacts which may appear due to presence of distractor and also, to limit the use CBCT as its repeated use is harmful. This agrees with Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and Abd-Elaal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">This study showed that, a mean increase in bone height was 6.7 ± 1.4 and 6.1 ± 0.9 mm in group I and II respectively. This result is in accordance with Saulacic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] who reported a mean increase of 6.88 + 2.52mm after VADO, and Pérez-Sayáns et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] who recorded 6.97 to 8.13mm increased bone height.</p>
              <p id="Par51">In this study, an overcorrection of 2–3 mm was carried out to overcome the significant decrease in bone height in both groups throughout all periods that was confirmed by radiographic finding. This bone loss was also reported by Saulacic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] who showed 3–30% loss of bone gained after VADO.</p>
              <p id="Par52">There was a significant decreased bone height in group I than group II. Lesser amount of bone relapse in group II may be due to CQ which contains vitamins and steroid, that have the ability to enhance metabolism and increase minerals absorption by osteoblasts, improving bone formation and retarding its resorption. This result matches with Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Srivastava et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par53">Improved radiopacity of regenerated bone was significant in distracted gap at different intervals during the consolidation period in group II. While a significant improvement was recorded at end of the consolidation in group I. This indicates that newly formed bone in groups II had matured earlier than in group I. This result agrees with Srivastava et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] finding as they observed a decrease in bone healing duration by about 2 weeks after CQ administration. This was proved by our histological findings that showed more bone maturation in group II than group I. This result is in agreement with Deka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">Concerning mean crestal bone loss around the implant, it was 0.94 + 1.16 and 0.75 + 1.53 mm in group I and II respectively at 6 months after implantation. This is in agreement with Adell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] who reported 1.5 mm bone loss around implants during first year. However, there was insignificant difference regarding crestal bone loss between both groups, but group II had smaller value than that of group I. This is in agreement with Bhagat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] who showed that CQ enhances stem cell proliferation and facilitates osteoblast osteogenesis. Also, this result is in accordance with Murthy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] report about antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of CQ.</p>
              <p id="Par55">There was a significant improvement in bone density around the implant throughout all follow up intervals with a significant increased density in group II than group I. This result is in accordance with Bhagat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">Serum Ca and phosphorus levels were insignificantly decreased in both groups. This is in agreement with Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While, alkaline phosphatase level was increased along all periods of study in group II than group I. This is in accordance with Nayak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Increased alkaline phosphatase level is an indicator for increased volume and mineralization of developed callus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Controversially, these findings are in contrast to Deka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] who reported an early decrease in serum calcium level, and increased alkaline phosphatase level in early time only indicating rapid callus formation in CQ treated group.</p>
              <p id="Par57">This study had some limitations s as small number of samples beside lack of previous studies evaluating CQ as adjunctive modality to accelerate bone healing in VADO. However, our promising findings encourage carrying more experimental and clinical studies to evaluate enhancement action of CQ in maxillofacial distraction osteogenesis is required (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
