                  <title>Materials and methods</title>
                  <p>This was a randomised, controlled, single-blind, 4-period crossover clinical trial. Thirty elderly participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated into 4 groups, which determined the sequence of the 4 toothbrushes: CUdent/extra soft, CUdent/soft, GoodAge, and Colgate. The participants’ baseline bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque index (PI) were assessed by one blinded calibrated examiner, then their teeth were professionally cleaned. The participants were assigned to use the tested toothbrush and were recalled for postbrushing examination 2 weeks later to evaluate their BOP and PI. At the end of each test period, the participants used their own toothbrush during the 2-week washout period before using the next tested toothbrush.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The mean age of the 30 participants was 63.2 years. The mean baseline BOP score was 44.4%, and mean baseline PI was 2.7. Three participants dropped out; thus, 27 participants (15 females and 12 males) provided data throughout the study period. The participant characteristics and baseline data between the groups were similar. CUdent/extra soft and CUdent/soft demonstrated significantly better PI scores at the buccal surfaces than GoodAge (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). CUdent/soft had the lowest PI scores and Colgate presented the lowest BOP score in every comparison for other areas; however, the differences were not significant. No signs of tissue trauma or abrasion were observed.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The newly designed toothbrushes were comparable to the commercially available toothbrushes in plaque removal efficacy and reducing gingival inflammation. CUdent/extra soft and soft were significantly more effective in plaque removal in the buccal regions than GoodAge.</p>

              <p id="para0007">Toothbrush design influences an individual's ability to remove dental plaque.<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> There are numerous toothbrush designs featuring a variety of bristles, heads, and handle styles. However, there are few commercially available toothbrushes designed for elderly individuals. Newly designed manual toothbrushes, CUdent (C.U.Dent Enterprise Co., Ltd.), have been developed for elderly individuals. The toothbrushes are composed of nylon 612 with round-ended bristles and a flat trim design. The toothbrush handles are enlarged with an antislip rubber grip. The CUdent toothbrushes are available in 2 bristle types: soft and extra soft. However, the 2 CUdent toothbrushes’ efficacy has not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 newly designed toothbrushes used by elderly individuals based on plaque removal and gingival inflammation reduction compared with 2 commercially available toothbrushes. The hypothesis was that there was no difference in efficacy amongst the 4 toothbrush types.</p>

                <p id="para0012">The newly designed CUdent toothbrushes for elderly individuals were composed of nylon 612 (DuPont<sup>TM</sup> Tynex®) with round-ended bristles and a flat trim design. The toothbrush handles were enlarged with an antislip rubber grip. The CUdent toothbrushes had 2 bristle types: soft (0.006 inches in diameter and 11-mm long bristles) and extra soft (0.005 inches in diameter and 12-mm long bristles). Two commercially available toothbrushes, GoodAge triple lock and Colgate slim soft, were compared with the 2 newly designed toothbrushes for elderly individuals. GoodAge triple lock, designed for elderly individuals, has a large contoured handle with soft bristles. Colgate slim soft, a top-selling toothbrush with a normal handle and soft bristles, served as the control. Therefore, this study evaluated 4 toothbrushes (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The 4 toothbrushes used in the study.

Shapiro-Wilk tests determined the normal distribution of the study population's baseline characteristics. The descriptive analysis of the demographic data is presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for qualitative outcomes. Differences amongst the treatment sequence groups for age and baseline BOP and PI scores were analysed using one-way analysis of variance. The difference in sex proportion between the treatment sequence groups was performed using the chi-square test. For the clinical measurements, the average postbrushing whole-mouth BOP and PI scores from each participant in each period was calculated. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis for a crossover design assessed the effectiveness of all toothbrushes after controlling for the baseline whole-mouth BOP/PI scores. Additional analyses were performed on the BOP/PI scores of the buccal surfaces, lingual surfaces, and anterior and posterior regions using the same methods.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0026">This clinical study evaluated the plaque removal efficacy and reduction in gingival inflammation of 2 newly designed toothbrushes compared with commercial toothbrushes in elderly participants. Our results demonstrated that plaque removal was the predominant difference amongst the 4 toothbrushes. CUdent/extra soft and soft generated superior plaque removal at the buccal surfaces compared with GoodAge. These results might be explained by the properties of the CUdent toothbrush, which has a higher density of round-ended bristle filaments made from nylon with enlarged and antislip rubber grip handles, whereas GoodAge features a lower density of taper-ended bristle filaments made from PBT and a smaller handle without a rubber grip. Similar, but not significant, outcomes were noted in the other regions of interest (whole mouth, lingual surfaces, anterior regions, and posterior regions). The reason that significant differences in plaque removal were found only at the buccal surfaces is likely that the participants brushed their teeth using their usual techniques. A previous study found that most elderly participants paid attention to brushing the buccal surfaces, whilst 56.7% of the participants brushed the lingual surfaces.<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Moreover, other studies reported that less time was spent brushing the lingual surfaces.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> A 2-year longitudinal clinical trial found that the participants brushing with a conventional toothbrush kept the buccal surfaces reasonably clean. However, they were much less successful in cleaning the interproximal and lingual surfaces.<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Thus, the largest differences in plaque removal efficacy were observed at the buccal surfaces. Moreover, the anterior regions consistently exhibited lower PI scores compared with the posterior regions (1.9–2.2 vs 2.3–2.5) in the present study. These results were similar to a study examining the distribution of dental plaque on the dental arches 15 days after prophylaxis.<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Significantly lower mean PI scores were observed in the anterior regions compared with the posterior regions (2.1–2.2 vs 2.5–2.6).</p>
              <p id="para0027">Our results indicated that considerably more plaque removal occurred in all regions when CUdent/soft was used compared with CUdent/extra soft. Although both toothbrushes feature the same head and handle design, the stiffness of the bristle filaments was different. This outcome corresponded with a study that indicated that greater bristle stiffness generated more plaque removal.<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, the difference was not significant. CUdent/soft demonstrated a slightly greater, but not significant, reduction compared with the other 3 toothbrushes for whole-mouth PI. Our study revealed that all 4 toothbrushes were equally effective in reducing plaque scores. Similar findings have been reported in comparable toothbrush studies. Several studies compared the efficacy of the most commonly used toothbrush bristle designs in plaque removal. These studies indicated that all the toothbrushes significantly reduced plaque scores compared with the baseline scores; however, none of the manual toothbrushes demonstrated a superior design.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
              <p id="para0028">Unsurprisingly, CUdent/soft did not show the greatest reduction in gingival inflammation despite their slightly superior plaque removal efficacy. This may be because the average baseline BOP score of our participants was only 44.4%. Furthermore, professional cleaning at the baseline and prebrushing visits to set the PI scores to zero before using the next toothbrush likely improved the participants’ BOP scores throughout the study. Although the BOP scores were useful for participant screening, different BOP scores amongst the 4 toothbrushes was not expected.</p>
              <p id="para0029">The crossover study design allowed each participant to act as their own control. Moreover, this study design eliminated the factor of one participant's brushing technique being superior to another's as well as other factors, such as age, sex, manual dexterity, brushing time, interproximal cleansing, and nutritional habits. Numerous studies have used this design to compare toothbrush efficacy.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> The design in the current crossover clinical trial was balanced for first-order carryover effects, and the participants had a 2-week washout period.</p>
              <p id="para0030">Currently, there is no established study duration for evaluating plaque removal. Typically, studies have evaluated plaque removal after brushing one time after suspending their oral hygiene practice for 24 hours. However, the results of one-time brushing studies are not definitive. Therefore, brushing multiple times over a 14-day period was used in this study to observe the participant's postbrushing hard and soft tissue condition. Our outcomes indicated that the newly designed toothbrushes are safe to use. No signs of soft tissue irritation or cervical abrasion were observed in any participant.</p>
              <p id="para0031">We evaluated the study participants using 2 clinical indices.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> These indices are the optimum evaluation methods commonly used to assess oral health and the effects of oral hygiene products. The Quigley Hein Index modified by Turesky<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> was used to quantitatively assess plaque. This plaque index emphasises the difference in plaque accumulation on the gingival third of the tooth.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> A disclosing agent was applied to the teeth to improve the accuracy and visibility in plaque scoring. The BOP score was used in this study to represent gingival inflammation. This score is objective, universally accepted, reliable, and an accurate clinical sign for gingivitis that can be easily assessed and recorded.<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We scored the plaque and gingival inflammation on all tooth surfaces except for third molars, large dental caries, extensive restorations, or teeth with a periodontal pocket depth greater than 5 mm to reduce false-positive plaque scores.</p>
              <p id="para0032">This study has some limitations. The users’ skill may result in superior plaque removal irrespective of toothbrush design. We excluded participants who were prone to having problems with motor function. However, we did not measure the participants’ level of manual dexterity. Furthermore, the participants’ cooperation was uncontrollable. It was also difficult to compare our results with those of previous studies because the prebrushing PI scores were reset to zero. We suggest that future investigations of the newly designed toothbrushes for elderly individuals should be conducted over a longer duration (&gt;6 months) using an elderly population sample with various levels of manual dexterity.</p>
