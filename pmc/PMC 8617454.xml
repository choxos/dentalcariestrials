              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>An analog of the condylar guidance on an articulator is considered to be a necessary requisite in prosthodontics. Condylar guidance is described as mandibular guidance generated by the condyle and articular disc traversing the contour of the articular eminence.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] If condylar guidance is not recorded accurately, it will lead to occlusal interferences during mandibular movements. This may also increase chairside denture adjustment time, which can be frustrating for both the patient and the dentist.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] For this reason, it is necessary to record the maxillomandibular relationship accurately.</p>
              <p>Articulators attempt to simulate mandibular movement. The ability to simulate mandibular movement in the articulator is dependent on design of the articulator, ability in recording condylar guidance determinants, and programming of the articulator to those determinants.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p>
              <p>The condylar inclinations provided in semi-adjustable articulators are horizontal and lateral condylar inclinations. Horizontal condylar inclination (HCI) is usually obtained with protrusive interocclusal record and the lateral condylar inclination can be calculated either from HCI using Hanau's formula or with individual lateral records.</p>
              <p>There has been unreliability of recording and reproducing the condylar guidance on semi-adjustable articulators. Consecutive condylar guidance angles recorded showed variation between operators, between recording materials, and between articulators.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Apart from the previously mentioned methods, condylar guidance can also be measured from radiographs. Compared to clinical methods, radiographic measurement involves stable bony landmarks and can be standardized.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p>
              <p>Recently, digital panoramic radiography has made them safer, more accurate, and comparatively cheaper resulting in their widespread application in many areas of dentistry. It can be argued that the application of advanced imaging is unwarranted in prosthodontics. Yet, the higher levels of safety, accuracy, and ultimate patient benefit from advanced digital imaging suggest that time may be ripe for its introduction into prosthodontics. However, evidence-based adoption of digital panoramic radiography for stomatognathic measurements and calibration of the dental articulators calls for definitive comparative studies in this area.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Currently, high quality panoramic machines are being manufactured which have much greater versatility than the conventional panoramic machines. Such machines have a capability for adding on a cephalometric attachment to allow exposure of standardized skull views.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This study, therefore, aimed at comparing condylar guidance measurements made using panoramic radiography and interocclusal wax records with interocclusal jig in healthy adults and also comparatively assess the accuracy and reproducibility of three commonly employed interocclusal recording materials, namely interocclusal wax, polyvinylsiloxane, and polyether in obtaining the condylar inclination values in semi-adjustable articulators.</p>

                <title>Obtaining sagittal condylar guidance angles from panoramic radiograph tracing</title>
                <p>Two radio-opaque lines are consistently apparent on the panoramic radiographs in the region of the temporal bone.One depicts the outline of the articular eminence and fossa and the second depicts the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. Radiographic tracings of the right and left side condylar guidance angle, were made [<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>]. A horizontal reference line was marked by joining the orbitale and porion. The most superior and the most inferior points of the curvatures were identified. These two lines were connected by a straight line representing the mean curvature line. Angles made by the intersection of the mean curvature line and the horizontal reference line were measured [<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>]. The same procedure was followed for 30 patients and 60 condylar guidance values (30 right sides and 30 left side of the condyle) were obtained. The mean of 60 Condylar Guidance (CG) angle value was calculated and tabulated.</p>

                <title>Facebow transfer</title>
                <p>Low fusing impression compound was conditioned in a hot water bath in a rubber bowl; it was uniformly softened and was placed over the bite fork of the facebow, and the fork was placed into the patient mouth. The patient midline was aligned with the index notch of the bite fork so that it is parallel with the patient's coronal and horizontal plane. The impression of maxillary cusp tip was made on the low fusing impression compound , soft tissue registration and excess registration materials were trimmed away. After trimming the impression material from the bite fork, it was checked in the patient mouth for accuracy and stability. With the bite fork of facebow related to maxillary arch by means of occlusal indentations, the stem of the fork slides through the opening in the clamp of the bow. The patient was asked to grasp both arms of the facebow and bring them backward to position the earpieces of the facebow in external auditory meatus and hold them in place with a firm forward pressure. The orbital pointer of the facebow is positioned to align with orbitale of the patient [<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>]. The bow was adjusted parallel to the line between the pupils of the eye. The locking device was grasped to resist torquing and the three thumbscrews were tightened in the following order, i.e., 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.</p>

                <p>A custom-made protrusive guide was fabricated prior to obtaining protrusive interocclusal record. Autopolymerizing clear acrylic resin (DPI â RR cold cure, Dental products India Ltd., Mumbai, India) was used to make a custom-made anterior jig [<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>]. The autopolymerizing acrylic resin was sprinkled on to the labial surface of the cast to cover the anterior teeth along with an extension of 1 mm incisal to the two central incisors. The palatal surface of the jig was trimmed into a flat platform. After polymerization, the protrusive guide was retrieved from the model, trimmed, and adjusted in the patient's mouth to guide the mandibular anterior teeth to the same protrusive edge-to-edge position. Softened impression compound was placed at the incisal edge of the jig and the patient was asked to bite in the same protrusive position [<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>]. The jig was removed, washed, and placed in ice cold water. The indentation of lower teeth on the incisal edge of the jig will help in positioning the mandibular anterior teeth to the same protrusive edge-to-edge position during impression making.</p>

Protrusive interocclusal record which was obtained by Aluwax was placed on the lower cast and stabilized. The maxillary cast was carefully guided into protrusion, slightly engaging the cast into indentation of the Aluwax protrusive record. The right and left condylar guides were rotated back and forth to accurately seat the maxillary cast into the protrusive relation record. The thumb nuts for horizontal inclination of the condylar guide were tightened and readings shown on right and left side of the condylar guide of the articulator were recorded. Similarly, other two records (polyvinyl and polyether) were used for programming the articulator and three readings of different interocculsal materials for protrusive condylar angle were obtained. The same procedure was repeated for all 30 patients and the mean protrusive condylar guidance angle was calculated and tabulated.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The importance of condylar guidance has been stressed upon by many researchers with their main concern to record condylar guidance accurately and transfer the same to the articulator. Condylar guidance depends on the steepness of the glenoid fossae. The steeper the contour of glenoid fossae, more will be the condylar force on the anterior region during protrusion. Many practitioners rely on average values of condylar guidance, which range from 22Â° to 65Â°.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p>
              <p>For dentate patients, the paths which the condyles follow in the glenoid fossae are determined by (1) bony limitations which comprise the joint, (2) direction and tonicity of the attaching muscles, and (3) limitation of movement imposed by attaching ligaments. When a natural dentition is present, the leading role in the dictation of the condylar path is played by the teeth.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p>
              <p>The accuracy of an interocclusal record is influenced not only by the material properties but also by the recording technique, as well as the reliability of the mandibular position influenced by the occlusal contacts, muscular action, or tissue changes within the joints. Moreover, the accuracy of fit of the recording material on the study or working casts seems to be a critical factor in the whole procedure.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p>
              <p>Elastomers as interocclusal record materials consistently yielded the least error among the materials studied.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] They are easy to manipulate and do not need a carrier when used in the mouth. They offer little or no resistance to closure, set to a consistency that makes them easy to trim without distortion, and accurately reproduce tooth details.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p>
              <p>Most of the studies comparing the efficiency of interocclusal recording materials were done on the laboratory simulated models at MICP. Clinical studies comparing the effects of different interocclusal recording materials as to the levels of their accuracy and reproducibility of horizontal condylar registrations in semi-adjustable articulators have not been studied adequately.</p>
              <p>In view of the above, the present clinical study was conducted to comparatively assess the effects of three commonly employed interocclusal recording materials, namely interocclusal wax, polyvinyl siloxanes, and polyether in obtaining the condylar guidance angle values in a semi-adjustable arcon articulator for their reproducibility of protrusive condylar guidance and their evaluation with panoramic radiographic method.</p>
              <p>In this study, 30 patients aged between 20 and 40 years with a full complement of dentition were selected. Two sets of maxillary and mandibular impression were made and poured with Type III dental stone. One set was used for mounting on articulator and the other one for fabrication of protrusive jig.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Articulation was done in MICP via bite registration records. A custom-made protrusive guide was fabricated to allow edge-to-edge contact of anterior teeth with 6 mm of protrusion.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The use of the anterior jig provided the desired amount of interocclusal space for the recording material and practically eliminated the risk of mandibular deviation due to muscle fatigue. The amount of protrusion has a direct influence on the amount of separation between the posterior teeth and on stomatognathic apparatus.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p>
              <p>A total of 30 (3 Ã 30 = 90) protrusive records obtained using anterior jig were used to program the articulator which gave 180 condylar guidance values (right and left). Many methods are used to determine the sagittal condylar guidance such as wear facets,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] intraoral protrusive record, extraoral method such as mandibular motion analyzer,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] tracing method,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and electronic pantography.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, the most frequently used method in the articular individualization is eccentric interocclusal records.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The procedure is simple and quick, and applicable in daily clinical practice.</p>
              <p>During the study, all the interocclusal records were handled carefully and were used immediately to program the articulator to reduce any time dependant distortion. Abrupt withdrawal of interoccusal material might produce dimensional changes in both horizontal and vertical planes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p>
              <p>Data obtained from 30 patients were tabulated and analyzed. The mean sagittal condylar guidance angle from panoramic radiograph was calculated. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that higher mean condylar inclination (deg) was recorded in polyether method followed by polyvinyl siloxane and wax methods. The difference in mean condylar inclination (deg) was found to be statistically significant among the groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
              <p>Bonferroni method was carried out to find out significant difference between groups [<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>]. Shows the difference in mean condylar inclination (deg) and was found to be statistically significant between wax and polyvinyl siloxane (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) as well as between wax and polyether (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was observed between polyvinyl siloxane and polyether (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
              <p>Among all the three interocclusal materials, wax was found to be statistically significant and thus found to be highly variable and unreliable as interocclusal recording material. Literature shows protrusive condylar guidance registration using waxes which shows greater variation with ranges up to l0Â° between articulators.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Polyvinyl siloxane exhibited the greatest resistance to compression,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and polyether and polyvinyl siloxane produced the lowest vertical discrepancy in mounted casts with greatest by wax.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p>
              <p>In this study the angles which were recorded by interocclusal materials and OPG were between 30Â° and 50Â° which was in accordance to other studies by various authors where they found variations in condylar guidance angles ranging from 5Â° to 55Â°.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] A review stated that âno radiographically determined sagittal condylar guidance angle coincided with that obtained with the use of intra-oral records. The radiographically determined angle showed a greater mean value than that determined by intra-oral records.â[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p>
              <p>In this study, the mean CG angle value obtained by OPG is compared [<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>] with mean CG angle value obtained by all three different interoccusal materials. It was found that there were statistically significant values (deg) between OPG (38.77) and Aluwax (34.85) with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and there was no statistically significant value between OPG and polyvinyl siloxane and polyether <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
              <p>Studies have stated that Whip Mix consistently gave the highest angulations and Hanau the lowest, in the same patients.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The present study supports previous studies showing intraoral methods of recording condylar guidance angles have lower levels of reproducibility and are subject to variations of instrument, operator, and occlusal records.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p>
              <p>Semi-adjustable articulator was used in this study which is limited in their capabilities to accurately simulate the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) and the jaws and their movements because of the fixed intercondylar distances and the straight condylar pathways, which are reported to cause errors especially in the horizontal and frontal plane.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Arbitrary hinge axis is being used to transfer the facebow record to the articulator might be the reason for variance between the radiograph and rest of the methods. Future studies should investigate the possible effect that TMJ disorders which might have on clinical methods. It may be beneficial to employ a panoramic radiograph for condylar measurements, especially for complex oral rehabilitations. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm the results of the present study. Human errors count is neglected as a limitation because it has been proved that the method of recording interocclusal relations and interpretation of condylar guidance values from the articulator is subjected to vary between examiners.</p>
              <p>The parallax effect due to positioning errors when making a panoramic radiograph may lead to a relative change in positions of two radio-opaque lines, i.e., outline of the articular eminence and fossa, which can be confusing.</p>
