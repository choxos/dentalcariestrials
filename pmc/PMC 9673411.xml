                  <p id="Par1">Changes in alveolar bone dimension after tooth extraction may affect placement of the subsequent implant, resulting in ridge deficiency that can adversely impact long-term implant stability or aesthetics. Alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) was effective in reducing the amount of ridge resorption following tooth extraction. There is sparse evidence regarding the benefit of ARP at periodontally compromised molar extraction sockets. This study will be a randomized trial to assess the soft tissue contour, radiographical, and histological changes of ARP at molar extraction sites in order to compare severe periodontitis cases with natural healing results and determine the most beneficial and least traumatic clinical treatment for such patients.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This research is designed as a two-group parallel randomized controlled trial. The total number of tooth extraction sites will be 70 after calculation with power analysis. Teeth will be randomly assigned to two groups with the test group conducting ridge preservation and the control group healing naturally. Periodontal examination, cone beam-computed tomography (CBCT) data, and stereolithographic (STL) files obtained by intraoral scanning will be collected through the follow-up period, and bone biopsy samples would be obtained during implant surgery. The primary outcomes are the vertical and horizontal change of alveolar ridge measured on CBCT images, soft tissue contour changes evaluated by superimposing the digital impressions, alterations of mucosa thickness (as measured by superimposing the CBCT data and STL files), histological features of implant sites and periodontal parameter changes. The secondary outcomes are patient-reported post-operative reaction and conditions of simultaneous bone graft or sinus lifting procedures during implantation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition which affects the tissues surrounding and supporting the teeth. Globally, severe periodontitis was the sixth-most prevalent health condition, affecting about 10.8% of population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In recent decades, the total burden of periodontitis has increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and it has become the main cause of tooth loss in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Molar plays an important role in oral function, while it presents a challenge for periodontal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and shows a higher risk for tooth loss due to its anatomy and position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">A systematic review reported that a certain amount of alveolar bone resorption occurs after natural healing, and more reduction can be expected in molar extraction sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This dimensional change of the alveolar ridge may affect the subsequent implant procedure, resulting in ridge deficiencies that can adversely impact long-term implant stability or aesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], necessitating additional reconstructive surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A consensus report concluded that alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) attenuated the bone resorption following tooth extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, the indications for ARP procedures have been widening from anterior intact extraction socket to infected molar extraction sockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Regarding infected molar extraction, Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has confirmed that the molar extraction sockets with advanced periodontitis did resorb and change in various sites, especially at the buccal wall of the socket. Fok et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported that prosthetically driven implants planning at first molar extraction sites due to terminal periodontitis poses greater challenge to rehabilitation, often requiring advanced augmentation procedures and sinus augmentation. Nevertheless, Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] revealed that ridge preservation at periodontally compromised sockets was safe and effective in reducing bone resorption. Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] concluded that ridge preservation could decrease the necessity of further regenerative procedures at maxillary molars with severe periodontitis during implant placement compared to natural healing sockets.</p>
              <p id="Par22">In measurement technique, most of the previous investigations usually used cone beam-computed tomography (CBCT) or peri-apical film to evaluate the change of width and height of the alveolar socket received ARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Only a few studies reported on the three-dimensional soft tissue profile changes using intraoral scanning technique for infected molar extraction sockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Histological analysis is valuable in assessing and determining the clinical application of ARP, since this procedure is often related to a following dental implant therapy that requires sufficient osseointegration within genuine bone tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Previous studies showed ridge preservation using deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) had a lower amount of new bone formation in comparison with natural healing after a follow-up period of 3–6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Further studies with longer healing time are needed for optimizing the clinical effects of ridge preservation in periodontally compromised sockets.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Although many previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of ARP, few studies have been conducted in periodontally compromised molar extraction sites. Soft tissues surrounding implants have significant impact on esthetics and long-term health for dental implant therapy, but the comparison between natural healing and ARP in this area is also lacking. The different histological manifestations and the effect of implant therapy for these methods are also worthy of further exploration. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial is designed to compare the efficacy of ARP and natural healing at molar extraction sites in cases with severe periodontitis. This study is expected to determine the most beneficial and least traumatic clinical treatment for such patients. The following aspects will be compared, (i) soft tissue contour and mucosa thickness change from the baseline till at least 1 year after implant loading, (ii) radiographical evaluation for vertical and horizontal change of alveolar ridge from baseline to 6 months after atraumatic tooth extraction and ARP, (iii) histological composition after 6-month healing period in /tooth extraction sites with ARP, (iv) periodontal parameter changes in the follow-up period, (v) patient-reported post-operative reaction, and (vi) finally the need of simultaneous bone graft or sinus lifting procedures during implant placement procedure.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par90">This is a two-group parallel randomised controlled trial to compare the multi-dimensional efficacy of ARP and natural healing at molar extraction sites with severe periodontitis. Since Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed the safety and effectiveness of ridge preservation at periodontally compromised sockets, an increasing number of studies has reported that ridge preservation in these sites was effective in reducing the amount of ridge resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] evaluated ridge preservation in the maxillary molar extraction sockets with severe periodontitis, and concluded that ARP could decrease the necessity of advanced regenerative procedures at implant placement compared to natural healing. A recent retrospective study included 418 extraction sites (171 without ARP and 247 with ARP) also showed ARP may reduce the need for bone augmentation procedure and improve the feasibility of implant placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. But most of these studies merely used dental records and imaging data to evaluate the efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par91">According to Avila-Ortiz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], peri-implant phenotype is crucial to peri-implant health, function, and esthetics. Soft tissues take over an important position in the components of peri-implant phenotype. The use of intraoral scan allows to record the profile of soft tissues without any pressure. It can be used immediately after surgical procedures without disrupting the wound. Digital scanned data make it possible to measure the dimensional changes at different time points in a long-term follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Up to now, only a few studies reported the three-dimensional profilometric changes on the soft tissue level based on intraoral scanned data following tooth extraction and ARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the esthetic zone of single extraction sites, Chappuis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] investigated the interplay between the soft tissue morphology and the underlying bone anatomy during an 8-week healing period by sequential digitized impressions and CBCT images. Wongpairojpanich et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] used intraoral scanner for monitoring the wound closure and surface dimensional changes of alveolar ridge at different time points (1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days and 4 months after ARP). Song et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] explored the changes of soft tissue dimensions following alveolar ridge preservation and spontaneous healing in posterior maxilla using intraoral scanned data and CBCT data in a 6-month healing period. To summarize, the follow-up time for current studies was relatively short. And to the best of our knowledge, there has not been specific evidence available to identify the soft tissue contour changes of ridge preservation on molar extraction sockets with periodontal pathosis before tooth extraction.</p>
              <p id="Par92">DBBM is a type of bone substitute material widely used in dental practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A systematic review included five studies showed that ridge preservation using DBBM had a lower amount of new bone formation in comparison with natural healing, but due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, limited sample size and high heterogeneity, further experiments are needed to verify this conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Koo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] carried out a histological analysis at 4-month after ARP in damaged extraction sites, showing a low mean proportion of regenerated bone and a large variation from 0 to 43%. Further studies with longer healing time in periodontally compromised sockets are needed for evaluating the histological changes of ridge preservation.</p>
              <p id="Par93">This study will produce data on hard and soft tissue dimension changes at different time points and provide histomorphology evaluation following ARP and natural healing in periodontally compromised molar extraction sockets. The follow-up period of this trial will last till at least 1 year after implant loading. These results may contribute to complement the missing information for ARP in molar sites with advanced periodontitis. Results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
