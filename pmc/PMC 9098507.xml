                <p id="Par1">Undernutrition is a public health challenge in sub-Saharan countries, including Uganda. In a previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a nutrition, hygiene and stimulation education intervention among mothers of 6¬†months‚Äô old children, we found less caries in the intervention group when the children were 36¬†months of age. We now examined the effects of (i) the intervention on the microbiota, (ii) microbiota on caries, and (iii) the intervention and microbiota on caries. The original RCT comprised 511 mother/child pairs whereas in the current study we had access to data from 344/511 (67%) children aged 36¬†months. The saliva microbiota was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Carious lesions (a proxy for dental health) were identified using close-up intra-oral photographs of the upper front teeth. Statistical models were used to determine host-microbiota associations. The intervention had a significant effect on the microbiota, e.g. an increase in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> abundance and decreases in <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> and <italic>Tannerella</italic>. Significant associations between the microbiota and dental caries were identified: Positive associations of <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic> and <italic>Tannerella</italic> suggest that these taxa may be deleterious to dental health while negative associations of <italic>Granulicatella</italic>, <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Abiotrophia</italic> suggest taxa potentially beneficial or benign contributors to dental health. Based on taxonomic profiles, the effects of the intervention and microbiota on dental health may be independent of one another. Educational interventions with emphasis on nutrition and oral hygiene may provide a feasible strategy to decrease progression of childhood caries in low-resource settings.</p>

              <p id="Par2">The United Nation Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end all forms of hunger by 2030. Although some improvements have been made, several low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa show slow progress to reach this goal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, there is increasing awareness that poor dental health is a major contributing factor to undernutrition, in particular in low- and middle-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Dental caries, a multifactorial disease consisting of host, oral microbiota, and environmental impact, is one of the most frequent chronic infectious diseases of young children in low- and middle-income countries such as Uganda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Caries forms through a complex interaction over time between biofilm formation and dietary consumption of simple sugars and fermentable carbohydrates that can lead to proliferation of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria in susceptible hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Notably, these nutrients are frequent dietary components among impoverished children in several low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>
              <p id="Par4">Educational interventions that focus on oral health may provide a feasible strategy to decrease development and progression of childhood caries in low- and middle-income countries. We therefore examined dental status among Ugandan children aged 36¬†months whose mothers participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) educating them in nutrition, sanitation and oral hygiene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We found that the frequency of cleaning of the children‚Äôs teeth was approximately twice as high in the intervention as in the control group and cavitated carious lesions occurred more frequently in the control than the intervention group.

The children were given age-appropriate toothbrushes (but not toothpaste), and the nutrition educators demonstrated tooth-cleaning. The rest of the household also received toothbrushes to avoid sharing the index child‚Äôs toothbrush. Moreover, the mothers were given instructions to (i) brush the child‚Äôs teeth with clean, boiled and cooled water at least twice a day, especially before going to bed; (ii) clean the brushes after use before storing them safely in a clean container, preferably with a cover; and (iii) not to share the toothbrushes. Mothers were counselled to stop the habits of licking the children‚Äôs feeding utensils and chewing food/herbal medicine to spit in the baby‚Äôs mouth. During the follow-up period, the field-workers visited the mothers on three occasions to encourage them to continue these oral hygiene practices.

From the 16S rRNA gene sequence clustering and annotation pipeline 155 and 162 samples from the control and intervention groups, respectively, were generated and subsequently analyzed. In the effect of intervention on the microbiota model (i), microbiota metrics are considered responses to the educational intervention as a predictor (treatment). In the effect of microbiota on dental health model (ii), microbiota profiles are utilized along with the covariates (age, sex and fluoride) as predictors of caries at 36¬†months. In the effect of intervention and microbiota on caries model (iii), both the intervention variable, microbiota profiles and covariates are used so that the contributions of both factors can be cumulatively considered and to determine whether the inclusion of the microbiota profiles improves the predictability of dental health in contrast to intervention alone.

The NTDC model‚Äôs adjusted R<sup>2</sup> increased from 0.008 (reduced model: intervention) to 0.041 (full model: intervention‚Äâ+‚Äâmicrobiota), a statistically significant improvement of the model (ANOVA comparison <italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.091). Similarly, the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> for MSD in the model increased from 0.012 to 0.056, with a model ANOVA comparison (<italic>p</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.043). Examining the coefficients and <italic>p</italic>-values of the taxa between the full and reduced model, revealed that including the intervention had a small effect on the associations between taxa and oral health. When variables are added to an existing regression model, it is common that the associations of variables in the reduced model weaken (coefficients become closer to 0 and <italic>p</italic>-values increase) when the additional variables are correlated with the variables in the reduced model, or the additional variables are stronger predictors of the response (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par19">Whereas the prevalence of caries has been markedly reduced among high-income countries from the 1970s, many African countries have faced an increase in caries during this time period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Consequently, many vulnerable populations, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from poor oral health, that in turn may cause pain, impaired eating and thus quality of life. Since the microbiota may be different between e.g. American and African populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, it is important to identify association between child microbiota and caries in African LMICs.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Consistent with previous studies, here we demonstrate that the saliva microbiota profile of children was associated with dental caries (a proxy for dental health)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We used three statistical models to examine the effects of the (i) intervention on microbiota, (ii) microbiota on caries, and (iii) the combination of intervention and microbiota on caries. Collectively, the results identified several important findings regarding the effects of the educational intervention on child dental caries a low resource-setting.</p>
              <p id="Par21">First, the intervention had a significant effect on the microbiota composition, while alpha diversity was unchanged. Three taxa were identified as significant with increased abundances of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and decreased abundances of <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> and <italic>Tannerella</italic> in the intervention relative to the control group and borderline associations with <italic>Gemella</italic> and <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>. Second, significant positive associations between the microbiota and dental health were identified (taxa abundance increased with increased NTDC and MSD) with <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic> and <italic>Tannerella,</italic> suggesting that these taxa may be deleterious to dental health. Concomitantly, significant negative associations between the microbiota and dental health were identified (taxa abundance decreased with increased NTDC and MSD) with <italic>Granulicatella</italic>, <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Abiotrophia,</italic> suggesting these taxa may be benign or beneficial contributors to dental health. As with the first model, alpha diversity was not significantly associated with dental health.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The associations between microbiota and intervention (first model) and microbiota and caries (second model), collectively determined a complex and polymicrobial set of microorganisms commonly found in the oral microbiota. These taxa have been associated with both dental caries and periodontitis, suggesting potential underlying mechanistic relationships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23"><italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Gemella</italic>, (increased abundances in the intervention group) are both members of the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> that share several general features: Both are frequently characterized as facultative anaerobes and can ferment sugars to organic acids that can demineralize enamel and interact with host defenses. Members of the genus <italic>Gemella</italic> can produce an IgA1 protease capable of degrading host secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), a property that may enhance biofilm formation by conferring the capacity to circumvent the adherence-inhibitory activity of sIgA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Since we examined oral microbiota, the increased abundances of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Gemella</italic> may in part reflect increased removal from tooth and gum surfaces in the intervention group.</p>
              <p id="Par24">The Gram negative <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Tannerella</italic> and <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> and <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> (Fusobacteria) (decreased in intervention group) are functionally diverse, but often noted as proteolytic bacteria. As such, they can cause damage to tissue directly through the production of proteases such as collagenase and hyaluronidase and they can participate in the inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The best studied member of the genus <italic>Tannerella</italic> is <italic>T. forsythia</italic> and is considered a member of the ‚Äúred complex‚Äù frequently associated with periodontitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> is an obligate anaerobe, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped and non-motile bacterium that has been isolated from both healthy oral and intestinal microbial communities. <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> can also produce organic acids such as acetic and succinic acids due to saccharolytic capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">From the second model, <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic> (Bacteroidetes) (increased abundance with caries) are noted for their growth requirements of high carbon dioxide level (at least 5%) and enriched media and have been associated with periodontal disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Like <italic>Gemella</italic>, <italic>Abiotrophia</italic> and <italic>Granulicatella</italic> (taxa abundance decreased with increased caries), are Gram-positive Firmicutes frequently characterized as facultative anaerobic bacteria that can ferment sugars to organic acids. However, members of these genera are also classified as nutritionally variant streptococci characterized by specific vitamin and amino-acid requirements for slower growth times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, their decreased abundance may also be benign due to fastidious growth requirements that may make them less competitive with other caries producing taxa.</p>
              <p id="Par26">From the third model, which examined the effects of intervention and microbiota on dental health, a lack of significant overlap was determined between the taxa identified in the first model (those taxa modulated by intervention) and the second model (those taxa associated with dental health). This finding suggests that the outcomes from the educational intervention and the microbiota may largely have had independent effects on child dental health as measured by dentin caries (NTDC) and the most severe caries diagnosis (MSD) at 36¬†months of age.</p>
              <p id="Par27">One interpretation of our findings is that the effects of intervention on dental health acted with greater strength on host physiological processes compared to its influence on the saliva microbiota. Alternatively, the effects of the intervention may be more influential on microbiota function, which was not measured here. Although the taxa identified in the first two models (taxa modulated by intervention and taxa associated with dental health) differed, they are nonetheless ubiquitous members of the oral microbiota that at least broadly share multiple functional features, further emphasizing that functional changes in the microbiota may be of particular relevance. Moreover, saliva as a sample represents a mix of microorganisms detached from oral surfaces. Other ecological niches of the oral cavity, such as biofilms from soft epithelium or teeth, could more accurately reflect changes in microbiota composition due to the educational intervention. Notably, saliva was collected by sponges because of the children¬¥s low age. Thus, it cannot be ruled out, due to cooperation challenges, that some samples may have contained more directly components of the oral mucosa and/or teeth including microorganisms from these biofilms. Moreover, possible cavities in posterior teeth were not registered. The current study lacks microbiota-data and information on dietary intake at the start of the RCT until the children became 36¬†months. A further limitation is the impossibility to detect initial caries on the photographs and thus associated primary colonizers. Notwithstanding this, important strengths of our study are the large sample size and availability of data form a robustly designed RCT in a challenging low-resource setting.</p>
              <p id="Par28">As we previously reported, despite the inclusion of a nutrition component in the education intervention, poor nutritional status was not significantly different between the intervention and control groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, there was no evidence of any association between the occurrence of caries and child growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In contrast to our current saliva-results, a microbiota examination conducted in fecal specimen collected from these children when they were 20‚Äì24 and at 36¬†months, showed no statistically significant impact on gut microbiota composition at either time point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Our current study suggests a complex functional interplay between the saliva microbiota and host. Beneficial effects may occur through competitive or cooperative interactions between microbiota, and microbiota acting as physical and biochemical barriers to host epithelium, while conversion of dietary sugars and carbohydrates to organic acids within biofilms can create local decreases in pH that contribute to caries formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Given the importance of diet on the structure and function of oral microbiota and the apparent independence between intervention and microbiota effects on dental health, our results suggest that additional optimization of the nutrition component of the intervention could improve beneficial effects on the microbiota in the context of dental health.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In conclusion, we identified a significant effect on the saliva microbiota of children participating in a maternal education intervention focusing on nutrition (oral) hygiene and child stimulation. We also identified potentially beneficial, or benign to adverse associations between microbiota and caries, coupled to overall less caries in the intervention group. The educational intervention and the microbiota may have had independent effects on dental health or alternatively, additional examinations such as measures of biological function or other oral ecological niches, may be required to better elucidate educational intervention and microbiota interactions.</p>
