                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">A novel sodium fluoride toothpaste containing lactate ion and polyvinylmethylether-maleic anhydride has been developed to promote enamel remineralisation and resistance to demineralisation. In this in situ study, we compared this toothpaste (‘Test’) with a stannous fluoride-zinc citrate (SnF<sub>2</sub>-Zn) toothpaste (‘Reference’) (both 1100–1150 ppm fluoride) and a fluoride-free toothpaste (‘Placebo’) using an enamel dental erosion-rehardening model.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In each phase of this randomised, investigator-blind, crossover study, participants wore palatal appliances holding bovine enamel specimens with erosive lesions. They brushed their natural teeth with either the Test, Reference or Placebo toothpastes, then swished the resultant slurry. Specimens were removed at 2 h and 4 h post-brushing and exposed to an in vitro acid challenge. Surface microhardness was measured at each stage; enamel fluoride uptake was measured after in situ rehardening. Surface microhardness recovery, relative erosion resistance, enamel fluoride uptake and acid resistance ratio were calculated at both timepoints.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Sixty two randomised participants completed the study. Test toothpaste treatment yielded significantly greater surface microhardness recovery, relative erosion resistance and enamel fluoride uptake values than either Reference or Placebo toothpastes after 2 and 4 h. The acid resistance ratio value for Test toothpaste was significantly greater than either of the other treatments after 2 h; after 4 h, it was significantly greater versus Placebo only. No treatment-related adverse events were reported.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">In this in situ model, the novel-formulation sodium fluoride toothpaste enhanced enamel rehardening and overall protection against demineralisation compared with a fluoride-free toothpaste and a marketed SnF<sub>2</sub>-Zn toothpaste.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par26">Erosive tooth wear develops as a consequence of intra-oral acid exposure from dietary and/or gastric sources. Such processes can cause enamel surfaces to soften and become more susceptible to abrasive wear or attrition, leading to progressive loss of dental hard tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the initial stages of dental erosion, the enamel surface can be rehardened by calcium and phosphate ions naturally present in saliva, removing this susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">As well as having a role in preventing dental caries, fluoride-containing toothpastes promote enamel remineralisation after exposure to dietary acid, leaving a fluoridated surface that is more resistant to subsequent acid exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This fluoride benefit has been observed as early as 1 h after toothpaste use in in situ experimental conditions similar to those used here, and seen to progressively increase after 2 and 4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previous studies have tested the hardness of the enamel surface using the ‘surface microhardness test’ to detect changes in mineral content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">The most common fluoride sources for modern toothpastes are sodium fluoride (NaF) and stannous fluoride (SnF<sub>2</sub>), with some studies suggesting that stabilised SnF<sub>2</sub> offers greater protection against dental erosion than other fluoride compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The formulation of a toothpaste has been shown to have the potential to influence fluoride’s ability to protect against dental erosion; in situ studies have indicated that some non-fluoride ingredients in a toothpaste formulation, such as zinc ions, sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium phytate, may modulate the effects of fluoride on remineralisation–demineralisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previously, optimisation of the enamel protection ability of fluoride ion has been achieved by omitting ingredients that either bind directly to fluoride or interfere with fluoride binding to enamel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The Test toothpaste in this study builds on this approach by also including polyvinylmethylether-maleic anhydride (PVM/MA) copolymer, observed to increase fluoride’s ability to enhance acid resistance in vitro. It also included sodium lactate at a pH controlled to 6.2, observed to enhance enamel fluoride uptake (EFU) in vitro compared to a matched formulation at near-neutral pH without lactate (data on file).</p>
              <p id="Par29">In this in situ clinical study, we aimed to determine the ability of the Test toothpaste to enhance rehardening (2 and 4 h after toothpaste treatment) of enamel previously softened with dietary acid; to promote fluoride uptake to that surface; and to inhibit subsequent demineralisation of the rehardened surface. The effects of this formulation were compared to those of a fluoride-free (Placebo) toothpaste and a Reference toothpaste containing 1100 ppm fluoride as SnF<sub>2</sub> plus zinc citrate.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par30">We conducted a single-centre, randomised (to order in which toothpastes were used), oral/dental examiner- and specimen analyst-blind, three-period, three-treatment, in-situ crossover study at the Indiana University Oral Health Research Institute. The Indiana University Institutional Review Board (IRB #1709160589) approved the protocol; the study was designed according to CONSORT guidelines and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and local laws and regulations. As the study involved human participants, it was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (#NCT03296072). There was one administrative change to the protocol prior to study start that did not affect study flow or outcomes.

                <title>Experimental design: overview</title>
                <p id="Par31">This study utilised an in situ dental erosion–remineralisation model developed by Zero et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] that has been used in a number of similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In brief (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), specimens of bovine enamel firstly underwent an erosive challenge in vitro, then were attached to a palatal appliance that was worn by a study participant, and the assigned toothpaste was used as directed. The enamel specimens were removed from the palatal appliance at 2 and 4 h post-toothpaste exposure for laboratory assessment by the specimen analyst that included a second in vitro erosive challenge. Further details of each step are provided below.

                <p id="Par32">Participants were recruited from an existing panel of individuals who had been pre-fitted with a maxillary palatal appliance capable of housing prepared enamel specimens. All participants were from the Indianapolis, IN area, where community water contains approximately 0.75 ppm fluoride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Eligible participants were aged 18 to 65 years, in good general and oral health and had unstimulated/stimulated salivary flow rates of ≥0.2 mL/min and ≥ 0.8 mL/min, respectively. Exclusion criteria included: presence of cavitated carious lesions (determined by visual assessment only), moderate or severe periodontal conditions, or severe tooth wear; wearing an oral appliance or orthodontia (except permanent lower retainers); any condition that might have influenced the study or impacted participant safety and wellbeing; pregnancy; breastfeeding; use of any medication that could interfere significantly with salivary flow; an intolerance/hypersensitivity to study materials; use of any investigational products or participation in another clinical trial within 30 days of screening.</p>

                <title>Enamel specimen preparation</title>
                <p id="Par33">Bovine enamel specimens (1488 in total), taken from the central area of the buccal surface of lower incisors (up to two specimens per tooth), were ground-polished flat until the enamel surfaces had a minimum 3 mm × 3 mm facet in the centre. Specimens were then serially polished with grit papers of descending coarseness, finished with a polishing cloth wetted with a 1 μm diamond suspension then sonicated to remove any adherent polishing particles. The resulting specimens had a thickness range of 1.7–2.2 mm.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Changes in the mineral content of the enamel specimens during the experiment were evaluated using indentation to determine surface microhardness (SMH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At baseline, five indentations 100 μm apart were made in the centre of each enamel specimen using a Knoop diamond under a 50 g load, applied for 11 s. Analysis of indent lengths was performed on a specimen level and then averaged, with a participant-level average value used for analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par35">For the first in vitro erosive challenge, enamel specimens were demineralised by immersion in 35 ± 1 mL grapefruit juice (100% juice, Kroger Co, Cincinnati, OH, USA; pH range 2.8–3.1 over the different study days) with no stirring for 25 min, then thoroughly rinsed with deionised water. This time period was chosen as previous studies have shown this to be an adequate amount of time in demineralising conditions for the surface microhardness test to detect changes without significant surface loss (in the absence of agitation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

                <p id="Par37">Participants were required to complete four study visits: screening (Visit 1), then three treatment visits (Visits 2, 3, and 4) at which each of the three treatments were evaluated in a crossover manner. Each treatment visit was separated by a washout period of at least 3 days that included at least 1 day’s use of the participant’s regular toothpaste and 2 days' use of a non-fluoridated (non-marketed) toothpaste immediately prior to the visit using a provided toothbrush (Oral-B® Sensi Soft Manual; Procter &amp; Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH, USA). At Visit 1, participants gave written informed consent to take part in the study and their demographics, medical history and prior medications were recorded. Oral hard tissue (OHT) and oral soft tissue (OST) examinations were performed, followed by saliva flow rate assessment. Eligible participants had their palatal appliance assessed for comfort, with new appliances made for those whose appliance no longer fitted adequately.</p>
                <p id="Par38">At Visits 2, 3, and 4, participants underwent a pre-treatment OST examination, then the study investigator (the oral/dental examiner) placed the palatal appliance holding the eight pre-demineralised bovine tooth enamel specimens in the participant’s mouth. An equilibration period of at least 5 min was given to allow for development of a salivary pellicle on the enamel blocks.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Participants received the study treatments detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> in a predetermined order according to a randomisation schedule generated by a contracted statistical analysis organisation using a Williams Square design balanced for first period carryover.

                <p id="Par41">At each study visit, following the equilibration period, the participant was provided with a new toothbrush (as above) loaded with 1.5 g of the assigned toothpaste. The participant brushed the buccal surfaces of their natural teeth only for 25 timed seconds and then swished the resulting toothpaste slurry around their mouth for 95 s.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par57">Measuring enamel erosion in vivo is technically very challenging. Changes occur on a micrometre scale (unless timescales are very long) on complex dental surfaces without stable reference points [2]. Studies with in situ models are therefore widely accepted as the current industry-standard approach to assessing treatment effects on acid erosion processes. This approach does have the limitation that such models cannot fully mimic the clinical situation; however, because enamel surfaces for in situ studies can be prepared in advance and changes measured outside of the mouth while treatment and remineralisation occur in the mouth, measurements are relatively precise, control of treatment conditions is high, and measurable changes can occur on short time-scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par58">The present in situ model was designed to monitor erosive demineralisation and remineralisation processes representing typical daily behaviour. Many individuals consume an acidic beverage at breakfast, such as orange or grapefruit juice, which may soften the enamel surface (first stage of dental erosion). They may then brush with a fluoridated toothpaste, which supplies fluoride for several hours to enhance saliva-mediated rehardening of the softened enamel. This may be followed by an additional dietary erosive challenge from an acidic drink some hours later. The aim of the model is therefore to mimic such a scenario, modelling the very earliest stages of erosive demineralisation, followed by fluoride-enhanced rehardening and a subsequent acid challenge.</p>
              <p id="Par59">In the present study, our results clearly showed that the Test toothpaste – containing NaF – outperformed the Reference toothpaste – containing SnF<sub>2</sub> and zinc citrate – and the fluoride-free Placebo toothpaste in terms of enamel rehardening. They also showed that the NaF Test toothpaste provided superior overall protection of the enamel surface through a cycle of treatment-induced rehardening and acid-induced demineralisation (RER). The specific measure of enamel acid resistance post-rehardening, ARR, showed superiority of the NaF toothpaste at the 2 h timepoint; this difference was no longer statistically significant at the 4 h timepoint (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1071). It seems that the high acid resistance after rehardening (relative to before treatment) for the Test toothpaste group is due primarily to the high level of fluoride incorporated into the newly-formed mineral. The superior EFU of the Test toothpaste treatment compared to the other two treatments supports these differences in mineralisation measures.</p>
              <p id="Par60">The low uptake of fluoride from the reference SnF<sub>2</sub>-Zn toothpaste, and absence of rehardening over-and-above the placebo in this type of model, is consistent with in vitro observations that stannous ions can inhibit enamel remineralisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The relatively high resistance to acid, in spite of the low fluoride uptake, also suggests stannous ions inhibited enamel demineralisation, in addition to the inhibition provided by fluoride in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par61">The modes of action of the key extra ingredients of the NaF formulation, i.e., lactate ion and PVM/MA copolymer at pH 6.2, are not yet fully understood. Certain carboxylic acid polymers have been shown in vitro to enhance resistance to demineralisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is assumed that multi-point attachment of polycarboxylic acid polymer chains, such as PVM/MA, tends to stabilise the surface against demineralisation challenges. Reducing pH from the neutral range typical of conventional dentifrices is well-established to increase EFU from fluoride products in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. At pH 6.2, in the presence of lactate ion, higher EFU has been observed in vitro compared to a neutral, lactate-free equivalent formulation (data on file). It should be noted that specific effects of these agents in a clinical situation have yet to be demonstrated.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par62">Within the limitations imposed by this short-term, in situ dental erosion rehardening model, a NaF dentifrice containing PVM/MA copolymer and lactate ion at pH 6.2 provided enhanced enamel rehardening and greater overall protection from subsequent in vitro enamel demineralisation, compared with a fluoride-free toothpaste and a marketed anti-erosion toothpaste. While the performance of the novel Test dentifrice in this model has been demonstrated, the mode of action of the ingredients in the formulation have not been established and this area warrants further research.</p>
