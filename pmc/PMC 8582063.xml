                  <title>Methods: </title>
                  <p>In this quasi-experimental study, samples were selected using a convenience
quota sampling technique, in a public dental school. At first, caries risk
profile was determined for each subject using the Cariogram before brackets
bonding. The sample size consisted of 36 patients. The intervention group (n
= 18) received preventive programs, and the control group (n = 18) was
trained based on the routine oral health education by means of pamphlets.
Then, Cariogram parameters were calculated for patients in both groups after
six months. </p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p> The age range of participants was from 12 to 29 years. The mean percentage
of the <italic toggle="yes">“Actual chance of avoiding new cavities”</italic> section in
the intervention group increased from 45.72 ± 21.64 to 62.50 ± 17.64.
However, the mean percentage of other parameters - such as
<italic toggle="yes">“Diet”</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">“Bacteria”</italic> and
<italic toggle="yes">“Susceptibility” -</italic> decreased after six months
(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt; 0.001). Besides, the differences in the mean
percentage between intervention and control group at the end of the study
period (T<sub>1</sub>) related to the Cariogram parameters were
statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt; 0.001). Accordingly, the
mean percentage of <italic toggle="yes">‘Actual chance of avoiding new
cavities’’</italic> parameter in the intervention group (62.50) was
statistically higher than in the control group (42.44)
(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt; 0.001). </p>

                  <p>Nesse estudo quase-experimental, as amostras foram selecionadas por meio de
uma técnica de amostragem por cota de conveniência, em uma faculdade pública
de Odontologia. Inicialmente, o perfil de risco de cárie foi determinado
para cada indivíduo usando o Cariogram antes da colagem dos braquetes. A
amostra consistiu de 36 pacientes: o grupo experimental (n = 18) recebeu
programas preventivos, e o grupo controle (n = 18) recebeu orientações sobre
a saúde bucal por meio de folhetos. Após seis meses, os parâmetros obtidos
por meio do Cariogram foram calculados novamente para os pacientes de ambos
os grupos. </p>

                  <title>Resultados: </title>
                  <p>A faixa etária dos participantes foi de 12 a 29 anos. A porcentagem média da
seção <italic toggle="yes">“Probabilidade real de prevenir novas cáries”</italic> no
grupo experimental aumentou de 45,72 ± 21,64 para 62,50 ± 17,64. Por outro
lado, a porcentagem média de outros parâmetros - como
<italic toggle="yes">“Dieta”</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">“Bactérias”</italic> e
<italic toggle="yes">“Suscetibilidade” -</italic> diminuiu após seis meses
(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt; 0,001). Além disso, as diferenças nas
porcentagens médias entre o grupo experimental e o grupo controle ao fim do
estudo (T<sub>1</sub>), relacionadas aos parâmetros do Cariogram, foram
estatisticamente significativas (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt; 0,001). Assim, a
porcentagem média do parâmetro <italic toggle="yes">“Probabilidade real de prevenir novas
cáries”</italic> no grupo experimental (62,50) foi estatisticamente
maior do que no grupo controle (42,44) (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt; 0,001). </p>

                  <p>A implementação de diferentes abordagens preventivas pode reduzir o risco de

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Oral cavity is the habitat of various bacterial species, mycoplasma, protozoa, and
yeasts, and any external interference can disturb the balance of microbiota in this
environment.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The traditional concept of caries as a multifactorial transmittable and
infectious disease has been questioned. The current etiological concept of dental
caries has emphasized the important role of sugars in caries. The current definition
points toward an ecological disease caused by the commensal microbiota that, under
ecological imbalances, mainly due to high and or frequent sugars consumption,
creates a state of dysbiosis in the dental biofilm. It is currently accepted that
caries is a sugars and biofilm-dependent disease. Acid-producing bacteria and other
factors facilitate the development of dental caries. Also, salivary flow, fluoride
exposure, plaque accumulation, tooth morphology and structure would create more
favorable or adverse conditions for the causal relation between sugars and the
dental biofilm to induce carious lesions.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>

              <p>The development of dental caries is determined by the balance of protective and risk
factors. If the dentist can recognize the relationship between these factors and the
development of the disease or its relapse, the risk of caries will be reduced.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>

              <p>Caries Risk Assessment (CRA) is an important phase in dental treatment based on the
strategy of minimally invasive therapy, in which therapeutic and prophylactic
measures are planned, based on the results of CRA.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> There is a number of available questionnaires and tests that first identify
the level of risk exclusively for each patient, and allocate that individual into
one of these three categories: low risk, moderate risk, or high risk. Cariogram
model evaluates the data based on its algorithm and presents the results as a
circular color chart representing five different groups of indicators, including:
“Actual chance to avoid new cavities”, Diet, Bacteria, Susceptibility, and

              <p>Next, appropriate preventive interventions may be done for each orthodontic patient.

              <p>Therefore, we attempted to assess the effect of preventive strategies on reduction of
caries risk in the intervention group. The present study was an experimental

              <p>The present study was approved by the regional Research Ethics Committee
(IR.SBMU.RIDS.REC.1395.250) and performed in complete accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was taken from the patients before
the start of the research. Moreover, the data was handled anonymously and with
confidentiality in all stages of the study. The researcher handled the data
pseudonymized in the present study to protect the privacy of study participants
while collecting, analyzing, and reporting data. The method of pseudonymization
comprised separating identifying personal data from the questionnaire and preserving
it with participants’ dental charts. In other words, two-time points Cariogram
questionnaires were linked using a unique identification code allocated to each
participant.</p>
              <p>The sample size was calculated based on the data obtained from a previous study<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>, keeping a significance level of 0.05, standard deviations within groups of
30 units, a least detectable difference of 20 units between groups on the Cariogram,

                  <p>Determination of risk profiles (low / moderate / high) for each of the
patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment was done through the
Cariogram v. 3 (Malmo University, Sweden), which evaluates the given data

                  <p>During the six-month study period, the researchers examined the patients who
were in the intervention group, and asked them to demonstrate the correct
use of toothbrushes and dental floss. The patients’ conditions were
evaluated six months after starting orthodontic treatment. All data were
collected again, and a Cariogram chart was drawn, to examine the outcome of
the intervention. Mean values and standard deviation of the assessed
indicators were reported in both intervention and control groups, at the
beginning and at the end of the period. Due to the normal distribution of
data, according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the independent sample
<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test and Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to
examine the effect of intervention on changes in the indices of the
Cariogram and the differences between the two groups.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The present study focuses on the caries risk assessment in patients undergoing
orthodontic treatment, and recommends preventive measures to reduce the occurrence
of white spot lesions or new carious lesions. The results demonstrated a significant
difference between the percentages of the Cariogram charts in the intervention and
control groups, and also showed that the correct and regular use of standard
toothpaste containing 1,450 ppm fluoride and standard mouthwash, using an
interdental toothbrush and orthodontic floss along with proper and practical health
education, can reduce the risk of dental caries - especially in highly susceptible
(due to potential plaque accumulation) orthodontic patients. </p>
              <p>The present study showed that maintenance of improved oral health over longer time
periods requires prolonged, repeated instructions, as explained by Zotti et al.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>, who evaluated the influence of a mobile application-based approach for
domestic oral hygiene maintenance in improving oral hygiene compliance and oral
health, in a group of orthodontic patients. This study showed positive results in
improving oral hygiene compliance of adolescent patients and in improving their oral
health.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>By assessing the risk of caries using Cariogram, a significant reduction was observed
in the intervention group patients, i.e., high caries risk subjects during the six
months trial; also, the percentage of patients with moderate risk profile decreased.
On the other hand, the percentage of patients with low risk profile increased in the
intervention group. Karabekiroglu et al.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> reported that a period of twelve weeks is long enough to be able to detect
preventive strategies; although other studies indicate that a period of at least six
months is desired in order to identify the results of caries preventive methods.
Hence, the present study was conducted for six months, being consistent with the
above-mentioned research. During orthodontic treatment, due to the presence of
orthodontic appliances in the mouth, it is possible to increase the chances of food
being trapped and to increase the number of bacterial biofilms. There is no
increased risk of caries under the orthodontic brackets, but there is increased risk
around them, due to the plaque and food accumulation and poor oral hygiene. Good
oral hygiene includes brushing teeth properly and regularly, as well as using
mouthwash, dental floss and the interdental brush. Lack of appropriate oral hygiene
in patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances contributes to tooth decay,
gingival recession, or discoloration of the teeth. The first sign of poor oral
hygiene is often bleeding from gingival margins during the brushing. Individuals who
neglect to take health/dental care during their treatment period face color changes
around the brackets, with square or rectangular caries at the end of the
treatment.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Recent management of caries involves treating patients according to the risk
(Low, Moderate, or High) and monitoring early lesions in tooth surfaces.</p>
              <p>There have been many studies about increased caries risk in fixed appliances therapy,
which has multiple factors in relation to orthodontic treatment, caries development,
plaque accumulation, and effect of fluoride.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In the present study, caries risk assessment using Cariogram indicated no
single factor explaining the changes observed.</p>
              <p>Also, the findings in the present study agree with the results of Mulla et al.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> study, which analyzes caries-related factors in patients undergoing fixed
orthodontic treatment over a period of six months, using Cariogram, although in the
present study the groups had undergone some interventions. The low caries group of
that study displayed significantly lower decayed, filled surface index,
lactobacillus and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus mutans,</italic> and plaque index after six
months, and the percentage of the chance of avoiding new cavities was higher.
Moreover, while another study concluded that Cariogram model can be used in
orthodontic patients with or without the use of salivary tests,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> the current study analyzed all nine Cariogram parameters.</p>
              <p>The efficacy of interventions for orthodontic white spot lesions (WSLs) has not yet
been sufficiently evaluated in an evidence-based method; however, based on the
review of interventions for post-orthodontic WSLs, monthly fluoride varnish use
appears to be effective.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Furthermore, Mannaa et al.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> concluded that the use of 5,000 ppm fluoride toothpaste for six weeks is
able to reduce the caries risk, which can be clearly demonstrated using Cariogram
program, due to increasing the actual chance of avoiding caries. They considered
salivary lactobacillus counts as a measure of the cariogenic diet, which may
indicate high carbohydrate consumption.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In the present study, in addition to the level of lactobacillus, the
frequency of meals per day (including snacks) was evaluated as a key factor in the
estimation of caries risk, which may have a significant effect on the dietary
component. In the present study, the scores of all Cariogram parameters decreased
significantly in the intervention group after six months, compared to baseline
levels.</p>
              <p>Also, a decrease in the high caries risk profile due to increasing the actual chance
of avoiding caries in the Cariogram pie chart, using 1,450 ppm fluoride toothpaste
was confirmed in the Karabekiroglu et al.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> study, who used Cariogram to evaluate the effectiveness of 1,450 ppm
fluoride toothpaste, fluoride varnish and chlorhexidine in adolescents for 12 weeks,
and found no significant differences between the mentioned preventive methods.
Likewise, Enerback et al.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> recommended the everyday use of high-fluoride toothpaste (5,000 ppm F) or
mouth rinse (0.2% NaF), in combination with ordinary toothpaste, to reduce risk of
caries during orthodontic treatment. However, saliva secretion and buffer capacity,
which are two parameters in the Cariogram, were excluded from their study, due to
time restraints and patient convenience - while all parameters of the Cariogram
program were analyzed in the present study.</p>
              <p>Almosa et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> used Cariogram to evaluate the factors related to caries between orthodontic
patients treated in governmental and private centers immediately after orthodontic
treatment. The results indicated that the percentage of an actual chance of avoiding
new cavities in patients in public centers was lower than in private centers (28%
and 61%, respectively). Also, DMFS, plaque index, number of <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus
mutans</italic> and lactobacillus, and salivary buffer capacity were
significantly higher in the public group, compared with the private centers. The
total number of caries lesions at debonding in the public group was more than two
times higher than that in the private group.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>The current study was conducted only in a governmental, educational dental school,
and supported the evidence related to caries risk assessment and individualized
caries prevention strategies as an effective method of caries management. Further
studies must compare large samples from different health centers (public and private
clinics), with subjects in various situations (socio-economic status), to confirm
the efficiency of preventive approaches for patients undergoing fixed orthodontic
treatment. Besides, the present study had another limitation related to study
design, that is, quasi-experimental design, which lacks true randomization. </p>
