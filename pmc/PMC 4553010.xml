                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The aim of the study is to reduce the high prevalence of tooth decay in children in a remote, rural Indigenous community in Australia, by application of a single annual dental preventive intervention. The study seeks to (1) assess the effectiveness of an annual oral health preventive intervention in slowing the incidence of dental caries in children in this community, (2) identify the mediating role of known risk factors for dental caries and (3) assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p>The intervention is novel in that most dental preventive interventions require regular re-application, which is not possible in resource constrained communities. While tooth decay is preventable, self-care and healthy habits are lacking in these communities, placing more emphasis on health services to deliver an effective dental preventive intervention. Importantly, the study will assess cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness for broader implementation across similar communities in Australia and internationally.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>There is an urgent need to reduce the burden of dental decay in these communities, by implementing effective, cost-effective, feasible and sustainable dental prevention programs. Expected outcomes of this study include improved oral and general health of children within the community; an understanding of the costs associated with the intervention provided, and its comparison with the costs of allowing new lesions to develop, with associated treatment costs. Findings should be generalisable to similar communities around the world.</p>

            <sec id="Sec1">
              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Globally, of the 50 most prevalent chronic diseases, four are related to oral health: (1) dental caries of permanent teeth, (2) chronic periodontitis, (3) dental caries of deciduous teeth and (4) edentulousness (total tooth loss) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Tooth loss is predominantly a consequence of dental caries in the permanent dentition and adult chronic periodontitis, and potentially results in substantial social and health consequences. Dental caries in the deciduous dentition is a significant predictor of dental caries in the permanent dentition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With few exceptions, both dental caries and periodontitis are preventable conditions with adequate self-care and healthy lifestyle habits, with additional health promotion and preventive interventions at the health services level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However we continue to struggle to significantly reduce, and preferably eradicate, the burden of preventable oral health conditions. Appropriate self-care is largely dependent on the social and health capital of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In disadvantaged, marginalised, rural and Indigenous communities, this is often absent. These communities also have the additional burden of limited health promotion and preventive services, carry a significant health burden and suffer a seriously reduced oral health-related, and overall quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Most dental health promotion and preventive services require professionally trained personnel, needing equipment and regular availability of the service for the re-application of interventions. The current evidence is that a number of dental preventive interventions require re-application 2 to 4 times a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; and in disadvantaged and especially remote communities, this is usually not possible, and the burden of the common oral diseases is never dealt with: more importantly, never prevented. To our knowledge there is currently no evidence on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of a less frequent and therefore sustainable dental preventive intervention strategy.</p>
              <p>The proposed study will implement a novel dental caries preventive intervention in children to firstly reduce the pathologic bacterial load using an oral anti-septic, secondly seal the part of the tooth most prone to decay with a fissure sealant, and thirdly to strengthen the tooth structure with a fluoride varnish, all during a single annual visit, in a rural remote Indigenous community in Far North Queensland, Australia. While there are data on the effectiveness of the three specific interventions, we have developed a novel approach to assess a less frequent combined application of these interventions. Importantly, we will assess its effectiveness and its cost effectiveness to determine the value for money of the service.</p>
              <p>The team believes that the current suggested frequency 2–4 times per year for these preventive interventions is not possible, or sustainable, in poorly-resourced, remote communities and is proposing an alternative strategy requiring fewer resources to address the burden of dental decay in children.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Burden of dental caries in Indigenous communities in Australia</title>
                <p>In Australia, dental conditions are especially prevalent in Indigenous communities, and are a significant health burden in rural remote communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A recent report of the dental caries status of Indigenous children in Australia showed that those located in rural and/or remote areas have a much higher mean number of decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth (dmft) (~4 in 6-year old children) compared to non-Indigenous children in metropolitan (dmft ~ 1.5) and rural settings (dmft ~ 1.8) as well as Indigenous metropolitan children (dmft ~ 2.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The situation is similar in the permanent dentition of older children. The National Survey of Adult Oral Health found that 57 % of Indigenous adults had untreated coronal dental caries, compared with 25 % of non-Indigenous adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The mean number of decayed teeth amongst Indigenous adults (&gt;15 years of age) was 2.7 compared to 0.8 amongst non-Indigenous adults.</p>
                <p>There are high social costs associated with poor dentition, and a diminished quality of life due to pain and discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and especially because of long waiting lists for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Social costs include lack of sleep, lost time for school, behavioural problems, lack of cooperation and diminished learning. Lost working time for parents accompanying children to dental treatment sessions has been reported to lead to a loss of employment. Studies in this area need to appreciate the full impact of childhood caries on the child, family and society.</p>
                <p>An oral health survey in 2004 (pre-water fluoridation) in the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) of far north QLD, found that dental caries experience of 6- and 12-year-old children was more than twice that of the state average and more than four times greater than the comparable figures for Australian children overall. Soon after this survey the reticulated water supply of the five small rural communities in this area was fluoridated. A follow-up oral health survey in NPA conducted in November 2012 by this team, in which we examined over 70 % of known resident schoolchildren (<italic>n</italic> = 339), suggests that the dental caries status has improved significantly since the 2004 survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Few teeth had restorations in both surveys. Age-weighted overall caries prevalence and severity declined from 2004 to 2012 by 37.3 %. The effect was most marked in younger children, dmft decreasing by approximately 50 % for ages 4 to 9 years; at age six, mean decayed score decreased from 5.20 to 3.43. DMFT levels decreased by half in 6 to 9 year old children. However, significant unmet treatment needs exist at all ages. To address this, practical and affordable ways have to be found.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons for the improved oral health status could be due to fluoridation of the local water supplies. Whilst the economic viability of water fluoridation for a small community such as this might be questioned, we posit the costs are outweighed by the significant caries reduction in both the deciduous and permanent dentitions as found in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, the fluoridation plant has functioned erratically since being implemented and has been out of operation since April 2011 following a lightning strike. The likelihood that the water will again be fluoridated is uncertain due to budget constraints and because the 2012–2015 Queensland State Government legislated to give local governments across the State the power to decide to fluoridate or not. Dental caries rates may again increase in the absence of water fluoridation. It will be crucial to investigate alternative models to ensure improvements in dental caries incidence in this resource-constrained community. The envisaged dental prevention model will essentially reduce the microbial load with the topical disinfectant, povidone iodine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; inhibit biofilm adherence to susceptible sites by application of fissure sealants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and reduce the susceptibility of the tooth to demineralisation by acids generated in the microbial biofilm by the application of a fluoride varnish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Measures of local fluoride concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and of oral mutans streptococci counts return to baseline after a few months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], so that most reported studies have used regular re-applications (2–4 times per annum), which would be difficult to implement in remote settings lacking appropriately trained personnel and resources. Fissure sealants, on the other hand, have excellent longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p>To date, the reported economic burden of childhood caries is likely to be underestimated, as previous reports did not capture the full scope of costs and missed the potential cost-savings of prevention programs. There are few studies involving child populations that evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prevention programs for childhood caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Savage et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] concluded that pre-school aged children in the USA who had early dental prevention visits would experience lower dental-related costs over 5 years. Similarly, a second USA study by Ramoz-Gomez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] looked at minimal, intermediate and comprehensive prevention programs and concluded that all three were cost-effective. They concluded that government health systems can save considerable resources by investing in early childhood caries prevention. A study by Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in Carolina, USA, found early dental visits were highly cost-effective for high-risk children. These studies reiterate the need for translating this evidence into policies for childhood caries prevention. Although the cost-savings of prevention programs are based on predictions, the potential economic benefits are encouraging.</p>

                  <title>Pit and fissure sealants</title>
                  <p>Dental decay most often occurs on the occlusal pits and fissures of permanent molar teeth. A pit and fissure sealant is defined as a material [both glass-ionomer and resin-based materials are widely used] that is introduced into the occlusal pits and fissures of caries susceptible teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Its application to newly-erupted posterior teeth is the best method to prevent pit and fissure caries, and/or to prevent the continued development of incipient caries into frank caries when the incipient lesion is sealed over. Sealing the occlusal surfaces of permanent molars in children and adolescents reduces the incidence of new carious lesions for up to 48 months when compared to no sealant. Recommendations and reviews of the evidence of preventing dental caries through school-based sealant programs suggest that it remains an important and effective public health approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Fluoride varnish</title>
                  <p>Fluoride varnishes are a liquid resin or synthetic base that contain a high concentration of fluoride and set quickly on contact with teeth, even in the presence of saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fluoride ions in the material are released when the pH drops in response to acid production in the biofilm on the tooth surface and these become available to promote remineralisation of damaged tooth enamel in early carious lesions (white spots). The fluorhydroxyapatite formed over time during the remineralisation process in an initial caries lesion is more resistant to future demineralisation. Children at moderate or high-risk to dental caries benefit from fluoride varnish programs. Varnish delivers a higher concentration of fluoride than other professionally applied fluoride gels and foams; therefore it is applied in smaller amounts.</p>
                  <p>The fluoride varnish layer slowly disappears over time and needs repeated application to maintain effectiveness as a primary prevention strategy. While one application of fluoride varnish may provide some benefit, the majority of studies of professionally applied fluoride demonstrate that at least two applications each year, for at least 2 years, are necessary to demonstrate effective reductions in dental caries, making this a difficult strategy in disadvantaged communities who are most in need of this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Children with high rates of tooth decay are much more heavily colonized with pathogenic bacteria than children who experience less tooth decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. PVP-iodine interferes with the ability of <italic>mutans streptococci</italic> to bind to tooth surfaces by disrupting the expression and production of glucosyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A seminal in vitro study of anti-plaque agents demonstrated that 1 % iodine (10 % PVP-iodine is 1 % active iodine) was bactericidal to intact <italic>S. mutans</italic> biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A series of studies have led scientists to conclude PVP-iodine is an appropriate adjunctive antimicrobial for use on teeth to prevent tooth decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Topical Treatment by PVP-Iodine in conjunction with Fluoride Varnish is simple [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The iodine comes in a single application swab. The total treatment time is 3 to 4 min and costs less than 20 cents. Clinically the teeth are brushed to remove debris and disrupt the biofilm; then dried with gauze, and painted with 0.2 ml PVP-Iodine. After the iodine application, the teeth are dried again and coated with fluoride varnish at the same visit.</p>
                  <p>As a result of our recently conducted oral health survey in the NPA, the research team has established networks and support from the local community, health workers and schools, as well as from Queensland Health (QH), the State agency responsible for all public health services. The importance of sustainable dental prevention interventions is evident, especially if fluoridation of the water supplies is not to continue. This study will assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and benefits of a novel single annual dental caries preventive intervention in a remote rural Indigenous community in north Queensland.</p>

As it is unethical to withhold any proven intervention from any child, no control group will be created. Children who do not consent to participate may be natural controls if they consent to a dental examination at the end of the study. The actual caries increment in the children who participate will be compared to the expected caries increment modelled on oral health surveys carried out in this community in 2004 (pre-water fluoridation); in 2012 (by the Griffith University team post-partial water fluoridation) and 2015 (baseline survey for this study).</p>
                <p>All consenting children will undergo a detailed head, neck and dental clinical examination and complete a questionnaire on their basic demography (gender and age), residential history (exposure to fluoridated drinking water), own general and oral health perceptions; oral health behaviours, attitudes and knowledge; dental visits; diet and oral health-related quality of life.</p>
                <p>All active disease will be treated prior to implementing the dental caries preventive intervention.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The proposed “Big Bang” preventive intervention is to firstly reduce the pathogenic bacterial load, then seal grooves on posterior (molar) teeth, and thirdly to strengthen the tooth structure.</p>
                <p>Oral health promotion will essentially educate children regarding appropriate health behaviours to maintain oral health, with emphasis on the importance of toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste, healthy eating habits, emphasising the role of sugar in the tooth decay process, and the importance of reducing both the quantity and frequency of sugary products in the diet.</p>
                <p>Prior to the annual intervention the research team will undertake clinical examination of all consenting school-age children to assess dental caries experience. A team comprising of a dentist and/or oral health therapist will treat all existing tooth decay and other oral health problems. Each child will receive the preventive intervention when other treatments are completed.</p>
                <p>Prior to the treatment of existing disease, we will investigate saliva of the participants as a component of caries risk assessment. Saliva will be collected using commercially available test kits for measurement of flow rate, pH, buffering capacity and then cultured for bacterial assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The number of teeth, fillings and other retentive sites in mouth influence the bacterial load and a high count of bacteria in dental plaque correlates with salivary bacterial counts, making it possible to assess saliva for cariogenic microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Such kits use selective media for mutans streptococci and for lactobacilli.</p>

Dental caries increment (incidence) will be the main outcome measure used to determine the effectiveness of the preventive intervention. The expected caries increment will be modelled from the three oral health surveys conducted in this community (2004; 2012 and 2015) and compared with the actual caries increment from 2015–2016; 2016–2017 and 2015–2017. The mean caries increment will be compared between the expected (modelled) and actual findings, and adjusted for known risk factors for dental caries. The hypothesis will be that caries increment observed in the period of 2015 to 2017 is smaller than the modelled caries increments. Two independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test will be used for the analysis with significance being determined if <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
                <p>Children who receive only a part of the intervention will be separately assessed: for example we will have children who fully participate, those with baseline and only a year 1 follow-up, those with baseline and only a year 2 follow-up.

The intervention group will be compared with the modelled values for a non-intervention scenario. To address the uncertainty in the costs and effectiveness estimates, univariate sensitivity analyses will be used. For all probabilities, the 95 % confidence intervals will be used, and for costs high and low values will be estimated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will also be performed by re-sampling 1000 times at random from the probability distributions for each parameter. This procedure is similar to multivariate sensitivity analysis and will address the uncertainty of all estimates simultaneously.

              <p>Tooth decay in rural Indigenous children is unacceptably high, and their general and oral health-related quality of life is significantly compromised. There is an urgent need to reduce the burden of dental decay in these communities, by implementing effective, cost-effective, feasible and sustainable dental prevention programs. Expected outcomes of this study include improved oral and general health of children within the community; an understanding of the costs associated with the intervention provided, and its comparison with the costs of allowing new lesions to develop, with associated treatment costs. The work will benefit Indigenous children and reduce disparities. If found to be effective and cost-effective in reducing dental caries, this initiative could be implemented in similar communities elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The study will provide longitudinal data on dental caries prevalence and incidence and OHRQoL for remote Indigenous children, a group often neglected or under-represented in national oral health surveys. The study will further provide information on the oral hygiene practices and diet (sugar) of these children. Data on the impact of a less frequent antibacterial intervention on the presence of the main dental caries associated bacteria in the saliva, as well as the retention of fissure sealants, will be reported.</p>
