                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The public dental care sector is striving to fulfill the preventive and restorative needs of Egyptians, including pregnant women, who may not receive timely care due to misconceptions about dental treatment during pregnancy. Because of this, they are likely to suffer dental pain, with higher risk of infection affecting their offsprings.</p>

                  <title>Aim of the study</title>
                  <p id="Par2">To compare the effectiveness of chemo-mechanical caries removal using Papacarie-Duo and Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) in reducing dental pain among pregnant women.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted, in 2019, and included 162 pregnant women visiting family health centers in Alexandria, Egypt, with dental pain due to dental caries not extending to pulp. Patients were randomly assigned to Papacarie-Duo group (n = 82) and ART group (n = 80) after stratification by number of treated surfaces. The outcome variables were reduction in pain assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), satisfaction with treatment, and time taken for dental caries removal. T test/ Mann Whitney U test were used to compare groups and Freidman test was used to compare change across time.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Pain reduction was significantly greater in the Papacarie-Duo than the ART group (81.55% and 69.43%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Patients in the Papacarie-Duo group were significantly more satisfied with treatment than those in the ART, immediately after treatment (mean = 9.60 and 8.00, <italic>P</italic> =  &lt; 0.01) and after 6 months (mean = 9.63 and 8.16, <italic>P</italic> =  &lt; 0.01). Significantly less excavation time was recorded in the Papacarie-Duo group than in the ART group (mean = 10.38 and 11.56 min, <italic>P</italic> =  &lt; 0.01).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Physical and hormonal changes affect pregnant women in many ways and the oral cavity is no exception. There are many common oral problems during this stage such as pregnancy gingivitis, benign gingival lesions, tooth mobility, tooth erosion, periodontitis and dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dental caries is a biofilm-mediated, diet modulated, multifactorial, non-communicable, dynamic disease resulting in net mineral loss of dental hard tissues. It is determined by biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors. As a consequence of this process, a caries lesion develops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The increased risk for developing dental caries during this stage can occur due to several factors; the oral cavity is characterized by an acidic environment due to an inflammatory response brought about by vomiting, gastric-reflux and changes in salivary composition. This is further complicated by the high sugar cravings that are common during this period as well as the limited attention to oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, the presence of untreated dental caries reflects unmet treatment need rather than higher incidence of disease during this period. Studies showed that if dental caries is left untreated, may in some cases result in further inflammatory complications which could influence pregnancy outcomes like preterm birth and/or low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Despite these consequences, pregnant women, sometimes, do not seek dental treatment, not only due to misconceptions about the safety of dental procedures during pregnancy but also because some dentists may be reluctant to provide dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 39% of the participating pregnant women experienced dental pain, which affected their daily normal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Whereas, in South Brazil, prevalence of dental pain was found to be 54.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unlike other types of pain experienced during pregnancy, pain due to dental caries can be avoided by early treatment instead of analgesics that may affect the infant’s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">There has been an increased interest in the use of minimally invasive restorative procedures as an alternative to traditional rotary techniques of dental caries removal to overcome its various disadvantages such as vibration, pressure and heat generation. These minimally invasive methods include chemo-mechanical agents and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">The ART technique involves dental caries removal using hand instruments, followed by cavity filling using glass ionomer. There is no need for anesthesia and pain is reduced to minimum. This approach was originally developed for use outside the dental clinic, in remote areas with no electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It can also be used for children, elderly population, patients with special needs and those who experience dental anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Shenoy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] assessed pregnant women’s response to ART, in primary health care centers, and reported a high level of satisfaction with the procedure where none of the participants felt pain during treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Chemo-mechanical caries removal, on the other hand, involves the use of chemical solutions which soften dental caries and facilitate its removal using hand instruments. There are two categories of chemo-mechanical caries removal agents: sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) such as Carisolv, and enzyme-based agents where Papacarie is considered its most common agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Papacarie-Duo, the newer version of the product, was developed in 2011, and has greater viscosity allowing more precise application, longer shelf life with no need to be refrigerated.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Most studies involving oral health of pregnant women focused on periodontal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], while few studies were concerned with pain caused by dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies compared conventional drilling and chemo-mechanical treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, only few studies compared ART and chemo-mechanical treatment, and those were mostly conducted in children. Only one pilot study compared chemo-mechanical treatment using Carisolv and ART, among 50 pregnant women, in order to assess the longevity of glass ionomer restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Given the advantage of Papacarie-Duo over Carisolv in relation to lower cost and time taken in dental caries excavation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], it may have added advantage in countries with limited resources and facilities, like Egypt. Therefore, if its effectiveness is proven, Papacarie-Duo can be a feasible method to treat dental caries and reduce dental pain among pregnant women during routine prenatal care in family health centers.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The aim of the study was, thus, to compare the effectiveness of two minimally invasive caries removal techniques: chemo-mechanical (Papacarie-Duo) and ART, in pregnant women, regarding pain reduction after one month and six months, their satisfaction with the treatment procedure and time taken for dental caries removal. The null hypothesis was that there would be no statistically significant difference between the two modalities in pain reduction.</p>

                <p id="Par21">A randomized, two parallel arms, controlled clinical trial was conducted among pregnant women attending family health centers for their routine prenatal care in Alexandria, Egypt, from January to October 2019.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The study was conducted in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Helsinki declaration; and it was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University (IRB 00010556-IORG 0008839). Permission to access the family health facilities was obtained from the Health Directorate of Alexandria. Signed written informed consents were obtained from patients after explaining the aim of the study, risks, benefits and confirming confidentiality of their response as well as their right to withdraw at any time. The trial was registered at clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04573608) on 5/10/2020.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par23">Pregnant women were eligible to participate if they were in the first or second trimester, had at least mild dental pain as identified by a score of at least 5 mm on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 100-mm-long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and with at least one carious lesion involving dentine clinically classified as a shallow or medium cavity. This cavity should be accessible to hand instruments (International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) score = 5 or 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). Pregnant women with acute pulpitis, swelling or fistula as well as uncooperative patients, those having severe gingivitis (Gingival Index (GI) score = 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), those who are unable to read and/or write and those who refused to participate were excluded from the study.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Sample size was based on assuming a 5% alpha error, 20% beta error and reported percentage of patients with pain after using chemo-mechanical caries removal = 68% and 35% after ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The minimum required number of patients was estimated to be 33 per group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This was increased to 40 to make up for loss to follow up. Pain and effect of the two treatment modalities was assumed to be affected by the extent of dental caries and; hence, stratified by the number of surfaces affected by dental caries into single and multi-surface lesions, creating two strata per group. The number of participants, therefore, per group was 80 with a total of 160 participants.</p>

              <p id="Par45">Papacarie-Duo was associated with significantly greater pain reduction, higher satisfaction and less time of dental caries excavation than ART in pregnant women. The greater effectiveness of Papacarie-Duo was more observed in multi-surface cavities when pain and excavation time were considered whereas greater satisfaction compared to ART was reported after 6 months in one surface cavities. The null hypothesis of the study can, therefore, be rejected. The current findings have implications for the dental care of women who suffer from dental pain during pregnancy and are reluctant to seek conventional treatment for fear that it may harm their babies. Even if dental caries extends to more than one surface, it can still be restored with Papacarie-Duo if adequate access for the instruments can be ensured. The duration of the trial shows that this treatment can adequately last throughout the period of pregnancy after which other types of treatment can be provided if needed. Further studies with longer follow up and with economic evaluation are needed to inform policy decision makers about the use of Papacarie-Duo as an efficient restorative modality in low-resource settings.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Pain reduction was greater in multi-surfaces cavities treated with Papacarie-Duo than ART whereas there was no difference in one surface cavities. This may be attributed to the components of the gel that contains papain enzyme which has an anti-inflammatory, bactericidal and bacteriostatic action. Papacarie-Duo removes carious tissues without affecting the sound collagen fibers in the affected normal dentin, and as a result, less instrumentation is required with less pain generated during excavation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This finding agrees with Ericson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] who showed that the chemo-mechanical approach is effective and more comfortable for patients compared to ART where operators sometimes tend to “dig” excavators into the hard carious dentine breaking off hard dentine pieces not only the leathery-firm dentin, thereby opening more dentine tubules which induces pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">The present study is the first to evaluate the effect of two minimally invasive restorative techniques (Papacarie and ART) on pain reduction and satisfaction among adults. Only one study by Barata et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] compared ART to chemo-mechanical caries removal using Carisolv in pregnant women, however, they assessed restoration longevity not pain and found similar clinical performance of the two methods after 12 months. Another study concluded that both Carisolv and Papacarie were clinically efficient in dental caries removal among those aged 20–40 years, while Papacarie was better regarding time taken and the volume of excavated carious tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">In the present study, there was a significant increase in satisfaction among patients with multiple surfaces cavities treated by ART, after 6 months, but not among those treated with Papacarie-Duo. This may be attributed to the fact that some patients felt relatively mild pain during excavation in larger cavities and thus longer time was taken to completely remove dental caries than in single surface cavities. This led to initially lower levels of satisfaction with subsequent potential for improved satisfaction as time passed and dental pain resolved. Although direct comparison is not possible, these findings were in line with Anegundi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] who reported that 60% of participants preferred Papacarie compared to 36.7% preferring traditional methods and Goyal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] who reported that 80% preferred Papacarie caries removal over the conventional drilling. Furthermore, the study conducted by Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] on adult population comparing Papacarie and Carisolv revealed that patients, in both groups, were satisfied with the treatment provided as no pain was reported during dental caries removal. Patients’ satisfaction may have been partially related to the dental pain reported at 6 months. This is supported by the significant negative correlation between pain and satisfaction, reported in the current study, at 6 months.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The present study revealed significantly shorter time of excavation in the Papacarie-duo group than in the ART, in both single and multiple surface cavities. This is because Papacarie-Duo softens dental caries so that it is easily removed. This is comparable to other studies of permanent dentition, in adults, where the time for excavation in the present study was slightly less in the Papacarie-Duo group as compared to that reported by Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and less than that recorded for Carisolv by Barata et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">One of the limitations of the study is that blinding could not be applied due to the differences between the two techniques. Also, patients who received Papacarie-Duo may have over-reported their satisfaction because of their attraction to the new material and some patients had difficulty translating pain to a linear scale. There was a slight difference between groups in the severity of gingivitis. However, both groups were in the mild to moderate level of gingival inflammation and thus, this minor difference is unlikely to affect the study conclusions. Also, in the Papacarie-Duo group, the cavity was considered caries free when the gel stayed clear. On the other hand, in the ART group, excavating till hard dentin was reached might have been responsible for greater pain felt with less pain reduction reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Future studies assessing these different non-invasive methods should consider having similar criteria of declaring the cavity caries free. In addition, chemomechanical caries removal can be used only if cavities are open so that an excavator can be used which limits the generalizability of findings only to those with this special form of cavities.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Papacarie-Duo is available at low cost (73$ per tube which may be used for 25 applications) providing a cost reduction of 42% compared to traditional drilling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Although no data are available about the market availability of Papacarie per country, research shows that studies about Papacarie are conducted in South America, Europe, India, Pakistan, United States and Egypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par52">This study was performed in public healthcare centers which mainly serve the disadvantaged communities. Hence, this new low-cost line of treatment is suggested for use in remote areas, deprived from proper facilities and equipment. In addition, this study aids in filling the knowledge gap by providing evidence about the effectiveness of minimally invasive caries treatment in adults which makes possible the translation of the results of scientific research to clinical practice. Future studies, based on action research, are needed to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of integrating minimally invasive caries removal into comprehensive dental care programs for pregnant women.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par53">Chemo-mechanical caries removal using Papacarie-Duo is more effective in reducing dental pain, in pregnant women, and is associated with more satisfaction and less excavation time than ART which offers an alternative low-cost method for treatment of dental caries among women who suffer from dental pain during pregnancy but and are reluctant to seek conventional treatment.</p>
