                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">It has been recognized that oral health education for parents is critical for preventing early childhood caries (ECC). Few parents practiced caries prevention procedures for their children in daily life, though. A novel intervention scheme using mobile messages will be developed in this study under the framework of the health belief model (HBM). The objective of the present randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to evaluate the effectiveness of the new scheme in promoting oral health of young children by reducing dental caries.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This RCT will involve 26–36 child care centers or kindergartens with nursery classes (clusters) located in Hong Kong. A total of 518–628 child-parent dyads (child age 18–30 months) will be recruited and randomly allocated at the cluster level into the test or control group with a 1:1 ratio. For parents in the test group, the intervention will consist of a set of HBM-based text messages sent regularly in 48 weeks. A standard text message will be sent to the parents in the control group in the first week. The primary outcome will be dental caries measured by dmft/dmfs of the children after 2 years (around 4 years of age). The secondary outcomes will be toothbtushing and sugar intake.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par15">Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases during childhood. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2017, more than 530 million children globally have dental caries of the primary teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The latest oral health survey in Hong Kong found that 51% of children aged five had dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and another study reported that 31% of children aged three had dental caries already [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early childhood caries (ECC) is denoted as any form of caries occurring in the primary dentition of children aged 71 months or younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ECC not only affects children’s oral health function, but also puts these children at greater risk of developing caries in the permanent dentition and results in lifelong impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, preventing decay experience in primary teeth would enhance children’s oral health-related quality of life and result in significant savings on dental service costs in the future.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Parents play an important role in shaping their children’s oral hygiene practices and eating habits from a very young age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which were strong risk factors for dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It has been recognized that oral health education for parents is critical for the prevention of ECC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, although large quantities of oral health education campaigns have been launched, few parents are conducting ideal caries prevention practices for their children in daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par17">A limited amount of information, engagement, and support can be conveyed by conventional health education approaches such as conversations or brochures. Mobile technologies are therefore popularized for their informativeness and interactivity, among which sending text messages has been proven effective in health-related behavior intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some studies indicated that sending text messages (SMS) was an effective method in oral health education among parents of preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An ongoing trial is now evaluating the effectiveness of SMS as an adjuvant method for preventing ECC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the age of children engaged in these studies varies, some of which could have missed the best time for ECC prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the present study targets younger children and aims to empower parents to establish proper oral health habits in their children.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Health belief model (HBM) is a social psychological model for health behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. HBM-based intervention has been introduced to the field of dentistry to some degree. A recent systematic review indicated that HBM has a significant effect on improving the oral health of school children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. No reported trial is available on how HBM-based intervention can be used among parents for promoting caries preventive behaviors in their infants. In this context, the effectiveness of HBM-based behavior intervention by text message is to be tested.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par19">The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the HBM-based behavioral intervention using SMS to promote parental oral health care behaviors (toothbrushing and sugar intake control) and reduce ECC compared to conventional oral health education.</p>

                  <p id="Par36">Parents in the control group will receive an oral health education pamphlet (in Chinese) produced by the Oral Health Education Division in the Department of Health, the Government of Hong Kong SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which is the standard dental care for young children in Hong Kong now. In order to maintain a double-blind design, the e-pamphlet will be distributed in the form of a mobile message. The participants will be told that they will receive some oral health information via the mobile message, without the content and the number of the message, so that they have no idea about the grouping. The selection of comparator is therefore justified.</p>

                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par37">The intervention in the test group will consist of a set of text messages developed based on the HBM to be sent to the parents regularly in 48 weeks.</p>
                  <p id="Par38">According to the concept of HBM, parents are likely to adhere to recommended oral health care for children under a specific five sets of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. First, parents must have some minimal level of knowledge about early childhood caries and motivation towards keeping their children caries-free. Second, parents must perceive the high caries risk of young children without good oral health care, and they must also be convinced that caries is a serious oral health problem for children, which could affect their general health. Third, parents must also be convinced that regular toothbrushing and control of sugar intake for their children are effective in preventing caries. Fourth, internal or external stimulus, referred to as “cue to action,” that triggers parental oral health care behavior in their children is present. Finally, parents’ self-efficacy to follow oral health care guidelines should be established and maintained during childhood.</p>
                  <p id="Par39">The text messages to be sent will be designed and targeted on the six domains guided by HBM. We have gathered the questions, inquiries, comments, and feedback from the parents in our two recently completed clinical trials for the development of the messages.</p>
                  <p id="Par40">While the set of standardized messages can be sent to tackle several HBM domains (susceptibility, severity, benefit), “cues to action” and “barriers” are likely to vary across different parents and life scenarios and might emerge anytime in the behavioral change process. Taking the advantage of interactivity (two-way communication) of text messaging, parents will be encouraged to share their concerns/experiences/thoughts via texting us back, which will be responded/discussed/solved promptly. By doing this, continuous support can be provided to facilitate the enhancement of parental self-efficacy (another HBM domain), through which positive actions are likely to take place.</p>
                  <p id="Par41">During the first 24 weeks, all parents will receive a text message (and feedback if deemed appropriate) each week. In the next 24 weeks, the parents will receive a text message every 4 weeks; altogether, 30 messages will be sent to the parents. All messages will be sent to the parents individually through a free mobile app (e.g., WhatsApp or WeChat) by a research assistant. The RA (dentally trained) will seek consultation from the two dentists in our research team whenever necessary before responding to the parents.</p>

                  <p id="Par54">The sample size has been calculated using the G*Power software. From our recently completed clinical trial on family-centered oral health promotion for new parents and their infants, collected data show that the prevalence of ECC for children at 3 years old is 15% in the control group and 7% in the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The reduction is 53%. In this study, we anticipate a smaller reduction, 40%, as the intervention will start when the young children are 18–30 months old instead of starting when the mothers were pregnant in our completed trial. Based on a previous study, the reported prevalence of dental caries of 4-year-old children in Hong Kong was 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Assuming the prevalence of caries of children in our control group to be the same (i.e., 36%) and anticipating the prevalence of caries of children in the intervention group will be 22% (i.e., prevented fraction of 40%, Cohen’s <italic>h</italic> = 0.31, a small to moderate effect size, considered to be of clinical significance), the required sample size will be 164 child-parent dyads in each group for the 2-sided test at 0.05 level of significance and 80% power. Considering a typical value of ICC = 0.03 in a cluster randomized clinical trial setting and if 15–25 children are to be recruited from each cluster, the design effect (or variance inflation factor) will be 1.42–1.72 (= 1 + (25 − 1) × 0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Assuming a 10% dropout rate at the 2 years follow-up, the sample size will be increased to 259–314 in each group, thus 518–628 child-parent dyads altogether. Then, 26–36 clusters will be recruited. [This sample size is considered to be feasible as our research team has recently completed a randomized controlled trial that successfully recruited 692 parent-child dyads from 27 kindergartens with a 2-year follow-up rate of 91.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

Prior to the examination, the child’s teeth would be cleaned, and wet gauze would be used for the removal of food debris and dental plaque present on the tooth surfaces. No compressed air will be used in the examination because the children are too young to cooperate. The examiners would observe the occlusal, mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual surfaces of each tooth. Children in both the intervention group and the control group will be examined at the schools at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years follow-up.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par82">With the rapid spread of mobile technology around the globe, mobile health (mHealth) has become increasingly popular in the past few years. According to the third global survey of WHO Global Observatory for eHealth, the use of mHealth has kept growing since 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. By offering care at a distance and mutual communication, mHealth service could reach remote populations, even those in underserved communities, enabling greater equity in universal health coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par83">There have been some mHealth practices in the field of oral health care field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Text messages, health care helplines, webpages, and mobile apps have been frequently used in these mHealth programs, among which the mobile information and communication technology was most adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The information can be conveyed via text, pictures, or multimedia. Although most investigators claimed that their program could successfully promote a good oral health attitude and behavior among the targeted population, few were empirically validated to demonstrate their effectiveness. Tiffany et al. identified 19 available mobile apps for oral health promotion designed for Android or iOS in 2018, with findings that the content of oral health care was unprofessional, and the design of most apps was not driven by a sound behavioral theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par84">In the present study, HBM is selected as the framework for text messages. HBM is recommended as a useful theoretical model to explain health behaviors, and it is also useful to plan behavioral interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. HBM emphasizes individual characteristics and cognitive factors, giving less attention to social influences and emotional components of behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. HBM suggests that health-promoting behaviors can be triggered by the presence of six domains: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived benefit, cue to action, and perceived self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is reported that intervention of psychological theories based on HBM could effectively improve oral health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, evidence also showed that HBM-based intervention effectively improves adherence to oral health care instructions among adults and school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par85">Previously, the emphasis of HBM-based health behavior intervention would be laid on susceptibility, severity, and benefits. The domains of “cue to action” and “self-efficacy” were less addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and barriers were not usually proactively expressed by subjects. In the present study, a set of standardized messages will be sent to address HBM domains of susceptibility, severity, and benefit. Besides, parents will be encouraged to share their concerns/experiences/thoughts via texting us back, which will be responded/discussed/solved promptly. With these interactive messages, the barriers could be addressed in a timely manner. They could receive enough cues to action, so that continuous support can be provided to facilitate the enhancement of parental self-efficacy, through which positive actions are likely to occur.</p>
              <p id="Par86">Dental caries is a multifactor disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], whose risk factors are diverse and, like most non-communicable diseases, related to social-economic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, parents’ oral health behavior is not the only associated factor of ECC. To eliminate the influence of the confounding factors, we will collect information on possible confounding variables and include them in the multivariate analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par87">Caries prevention projects among children involving oral health education are often delivered through primary care, home visits, or kindergarten-based programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, most of these strategies have resulted in small, clinically insignificant effects on caries prevention. By HBM-based intervention via a low-cost text messaging vehicle, the caries prevention scheme may help the parents establish proper oral health behaviors for their children and</p>
