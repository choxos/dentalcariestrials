                  <p>Response rates for mail surveys of dentists and other health care providers have declined appreciably over the past several decades. The objective of this study was to update evidence about the impact use of incentives and different mail strategies on response rates in a mail survey of dentists.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We randomized private practice dentists in Iowa (<italic toggle="no">N</italic> = 1267) into six study groups to test the effects of incentives and mail strategy on response rate. Survey incentives included either a $2 bill or a customized pen/stylus; a control group with no incentive was included. Mail strategies included bulk mail or first‐class stamps.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The overall survey response rate was 43%. A $2 bill incentive was associated with significantly higher likelihood of returning a survey compared to the control group with no incentive (48% response rate vs. 40%, respectively). A non‐monetary incentive was not significantly associated with likelihood of response. Use of first‐class stamps compared to bulk mail did not significantly affect response rate.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a $2 incentive to increase response rate in a mail survey of dentists. Given the background trend of declining survey participation rates, researchers should consider use of monetary incentives and explore new strategies to increase participation among dentists and other health care providers.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Response rates for surveys of health care providers have declined steadily over the past several decades [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the 1950s, response rates above 80% were not uncommon. By 1991, the average survey response rate in US biomedical journals was 59% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. By 2012, mean response rates among health care providers were closer to 40% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Further, significant variation across provider types has been observed [ <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent mail surveys of U.S. dentists have seen response rates as low as 2% (Fisketjon, 2018).</p>
              <p>This trend is not unique to the health care professions; declines have been noted in participation rates among epidemiologic studies in general [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Galea and Tracy (2007) attribute increasing nonparticipation to “proliferation of research studies during the past few decades,” contributing to an “over‐surveyed” society [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The rise of telemarketers, robocalls, and spam email over the past 20 years also contribute to survey fatigue. After following up with physicians who had not responded to a mail survey, Wiebe, Kaczorowki, and MacKay (2012) found that approximately one‐third of non‐respondents had a general office policy to not participate in any survey [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>A meta‐analysis conducted in 2013 concluded that monetary incentives—even those as small as $1—significantly increased response rates among health care providers [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, that finding was based on more than 50 years of pooled studies (1958–2012), so current trends could not be described. Similar associations between use of monetary incentives and increased response rates were demonstrated in a 2007 systematic review of physician surveys [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The authors noted significant improvement in response rates from 1975 to 2006 with monetary incentives as small as $1 USD. However, that study also included studies spanning several decades.</p>
              <p>In a 1994 cross‐sectional study limited to dentists, Fiset, Milgrom, and Tarnai examined the use of $5 and $10 incentives on response rates [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The authors concluded that magnitude of monetary incentive did not significantly affect dentists' response rates. However, without including a control group in their study design, that study was unable to offer any conclusions about the relative effects of any incentive. It is interesting to note that despite the lack of a control group, at least one subsequent study has used the Fiset et al. findings to assert that incentives do not increase response rates among dentists [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Researchers typically attempt to maximize response rates in order to reduce possible nonresponse bias in survey estimates, although there is mixed evidence that nonresponse rates are predictive of nonresponse bias [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Response rates should also be high enough to justify the direct and indirect costs of fielding a survey. Thus, while a large monetary incentive could elicit high response rates, this approach is not feasible for most investigators. Additionally, large payments could undermine the ethical concern of valid consent, operating as a form of “coercion and undue influence.” [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p>
              <p>Although older empirical evidence supports use of incentives to increase survey response among health care providers in general, it is not known whether this association currently applies to dentists. Thus, the primary purpose of this interventional study was to test the effect of incentives on likelihood of response in a survey of dentists in order to update information about the impact of monetary incentives in this population.</p>
              <p>A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two mail strategies using different forms of postage. At least two systematic reviews have noted an association between the use of first‐class stamps or a higher‐class mailing approach and higher response rates among physicians [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, we are not aware of any studies examining postage type on dentist response rates.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>This interventional study targeted dentists in private practice in Iowa (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1287). Dentists were invited to participate in the 2019 Survey of Iowa Dentists, administered between April and May 2019. General dentists and specialists, excluding orthodontists, were included in the study population. Orthodontists were excluded since the survey topic (i.e., Iowa's Adult Dental Medicaid Program) was not applicable. Dentists were ineligible to participate if they had retired, died, moved out of state, or had undeliverable addresses (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 20). Addresses and demographic data for the survey sample were obtained from the Iowa Dentist Tracking System, which provides ongoing monitoring of the state's dentist workforce [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Participation in the tracking system is voluntary, although participation is estimated to be 100%. Data are made available for purchase from the University of Iowa Office of Statewide Clinical Education Programs for research and marketing purposes.</p>

                <title>Study groups</title>
                <p>Dentists were randomly assigned into six groups to test the combined effects of (a) use of an incentive and (b) mailing strategy (Table <xref rid="jphd12510-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Excel was used to generate unique random numbers for each dentist; individuals were then ordered by number and divided into three incentive groups of equal size. Random numbers were then used to assign each group to one of the three incentive strategies. Incentive strategies included either a $2 bill or a customized pen/stylus; a control group received no incentive. The customized pen/stylus included the name of the research organization administering the survey. Cost per pen was less than $2. However, postage costs were higher on survey packets that contained the pen compared to other packets, as these were classified as parcels instead of letters. Two mail strategies were tested: bulk mail (non‐profit class) or first‐class stamps. Within each of the three incentive groups, dentists were randomly assigned to receive stamps or metered mail.</p>

                <p>The design and administration of this survey followed principles recommended by Dillman, Smythe, and Christian [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All six test groups received the same questionnaire. The primary focus of the survey was dentists' knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes related to participation in Iowa's Medicaid program. Dentists were also asked six questions about dental practice characteristics (i.e., full‐time vs. part‐time, owner vs. associate, etc.). Individual survey length varied depending on skip patterns based on Medicaid participation, with a potential maximum of 35 items. The complete survey instrument was eight pages in length. Survey development has been described previously [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The survey questionnaire was pretested with members of a national advisory committee and revised in an iterative fashion using feedback from cognitive interviews.</p>
                <p>Two contact attempts were made to all participants. A third contact attempt was made to non‐respondents. For the initial contact, dentists were mailed the questionnaire in a letter‐sized envelope with a cover letter that served as both an invitation and informed consent document. Dentists who were assigned to the incentive groups were informed that they were receiving “a token of appreciation” to thank them for participating in the survey. The pen or $2 bill was included in the first mailing.</p>
                <p>Individuals could respond directly using the paper survey and the included return envelope (with prepaid postage) or, alternatively, choose to complete the survey online. The cover letter included an invitation to respond to the web‐based survey with a URL and unique identification code, thereby allowing us to track online and mail participation. When possible, undeliverable surveys with invalid addresses were corrected with a forwarding address or by searching online for a current address(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 23).</p>
                <p>A reminder postcard was sent 1 week following the initial contact. A second copy of the survey was sent 3 weeks after the postcard reminder to those who had not returned a completed survey. No incentives were included with the second survey, although mailing strategy was maintained.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Demographic characteristics were obtained from the Iowa Dentist Tracking System and used to compare respondents and non‐respondents. Dental practice locations were categorized as urban or rural by applying Categorization D for the ZIP code‐based Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (version 3.10) [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Chi‐square tests and t‐tests were calculated to compare study groups based on demographic characteristics and to compare non‐respondents and respondents. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test use of incentive ($2 bill, pen, or no incentive) and the effect of postage type (first‐class or bulk) on likelihood of returning the survey. All returned surveys were included in this analysis; no exclusions were made based on response completeness (i.e., whether all questions were answered). A significance level of <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> = 0.05 was used for all hypothesis tests. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p>The effective sample size included 1267 dentists who met the inclusion criteria. Demographic characteristics of the total population of dentists and respondents are shown in Table <xref rid="jphd12510-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>.). The majority of respondents were male (68%), general dentists (91%), working in group or corporate practice arrangements (58%), and located in urban areas (63%). Mean age of respondents was 50 years. Compared to the overall population of dentists in Iowa, dentists who responded were slightly older (mean age 50.0 vs. 48.3 years) and significantly more likely to be White, general dentists, work in solo practice, and work in rural areas of the state.</p>
              <p>The number of individuals allocated to each study group ranged from 209 to 214 (Table <xref rid="jphd12510-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although study groups were not randomized by demographic characteristics, we conducted bivariate comparisons between each group and the overall population of dentists prior to mailing out the survey. No statistically significant differences in age, sex, or specialty were observed among study groups (results not shown).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This study found that including a $2 bill as an incentive in the first mailing of a survey resulted in a significantly higher response rate than mailings that did not include the incentive (48% vs. 40%, respectively). A non‐monetary incentive and different mailing strategies had no significant effects on response rate. Overall, our survey had a response rate of 43% — comparable to 47% from a 2016 survey of the same population [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and greater than rates seen in other similar recent surveys. For example, a 2009 survey of Florida dentists attained a response rate of 21% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a 2013 national survey of dentists attained a response rate of 34% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] after two survey mailings, three reminder postcards, up to three email reminders, and three telephone calls.</p>
              <p>Although the monetary incentive in this study was small, we have observed anecdotally via phone calls from participants that the $2 bill attracts participation as something of a novelty in the U.S. Although it is a current denomination, the US $2 bill was last printed in 2003 and is not in wide circulation. The appeal of a $2 incentive is consistent with a 2004 study of emergency physicians, which found that a $2 bill resulted in a significantly higher response rate (56%) compared to being entered into a drawing to win $250 USD (44%) [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further, larger incentives may yield a greater effect. A study of primary care physicians in the 1990s found that a $5 bill resulted in a significantly higher response rate (61%) than a $2 bill (46%), and the cost per response was comparable [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Encouragingly, that study found no differences between respondents and their survey responses across the $2 and $5 groups. Thus, a greater incentive may increase response rates without contributing to potential bias. Although those studies [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] did not include control groups, additional research has shown that nominal monetary incentives ranging from $1 to $5 USD yield significantly higher response rates among health care providers compared to no incentive [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>Monetary incentives have demonstrated consistent effects on survey response rates among health care providers appears over the past several decades [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the effect size noted in our study was smaller than that observed by Ulrich et al. (2005) [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], where a 22 percentage‐point increase in response rate was observed. However, that study was conducted nearly 20 years ago among nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who were noted to have historically higher response rates than other provider types [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>In a 1992 survey of dentists, Fiset et al. did not find a significant difference in response rates with a $5 incentive versus a $10 incentive [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, that study used bank checks instead of a cash incentive, and authors noted that 11% of respondents did not cash the enclosed check. That study also failed to include a control group with no monetary incentive, so the overall effect of an incentive on response rates among dentists could not be estimated. Nevertheless, bank checks may be more appealing now that technology allows individuals to deposit a check remotely.</p>
              <p>In addition to the $2 bill, we tested use of a customized pen as an incentive for participation and to facilitate survey completion. The additional cost, combined with lack of statistical significance, pens were not a good incentive for our study population. This is consistent with previous studies on non‐monetary incentives for dentists and physicians. A non‐monetary incentive (i.e., a £20 book voucher) used in a 2012 survey of dentists in Scotland also failed to yield significant improvements in response rates [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, the 2007 systematic review by VanGeest et al. found that the use of non‐monetary incentives generally, and pens and pencils specifically, did not improve survey participation among physicians [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Previous studies have demonstrated higher response rates from physicians with the use of first‐class postage stamps on return envelopes [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We opted to use first‐class stamps on mailings to dentists but not return envelopes, thinking that the initial perception of the survey packet would be more compelling than the appearance of the return envelope. That is, if dentists did not open the first envelope, they would have no way of seeing the return envelope. However, our study failed to demonstrate an association between use of first‐class stamps and increased response. Based on the increased cost and time‐intensive nature of applying first‐class stamps, coupled with the lack of significant association on dentist response rates, we would not recommend this approach with dentist surveys.</p>
              <p>Other methods to improve response rates for surveys include telephone and email reminders. A 2012 survey of dentists that employed both types of reminders reported an overall response rate of 34% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] – lower than what was obtained in this study. Alternatively, web‐based surveys offer a cost‐effective option. Although Hardigan and colleagues found web surveys to be nearly three times more cost effective than mail surveys among dentists in 2009, the associated response rate was only 11% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A more recent web‐based survey of US dentists, conducted in 2018, reported a response rate of 6.6% [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which may not be acceptable for some research purposes.</p>
              <p>One approach seen in recent web surveys is for researchers to recruit participants via social media or other open invitations [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This approach is cost effective, casts a wide net, and allows information to be collected quickly. One disadvantage is that response rates cannot be calculated, and sample representativeness cannot be evaluated. However, this may circumvent publication‐related concerns that would be triggered by low response rates.</p>
              <p>Finally, prenotification letters or emails may be used to alert individuals that they will soon be invited to participate in a survey. However, a 2019 survey of Canadian physicians [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that prenotification resulted in response rates that were nearly one‐third lower than rates obtained without prenotification.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This study was designed to address the lack of recent information about how incentives and mailing strategies affect dentists' participation in a mail survey. A major strength of this study is that it was conducted using best practices for design and administration. This limited the likelihood that response rates were adversely affected by poorly constructed design features, such as complicated skip patterns, poorly worded items, or unclear instructions. Dentists were randomly assigned to study groups, which contributes to validity of the results. Finally, this study was conducted in a population with known demographic characteristics, which allowed us to test for nonresponse bias.</p>
                <p>One potential limitation is that we may have lacked adequate power to detect differences in response rates. However, use of stamps and incentives was resource intensive (i.e., time to put stamps on envelopes, monetary costs). Lower effect sizes than the ones observed here, with a sample size of nearly 1300 dentists, are unlikely to be cost effective or feasible. Additionally, we did not test the effect of a stamped return envelope.</p>
                <p>The primary topic of our survey was Medicaid participation. Perceived salience of a survey topic can entice health care providers to respond to a survey [<xref rid="jphd12510-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is possible that responses to our survey reflect individuals on two sides of the spectrum: dentists who support this public benefit program and can be engaged to offer constructive feedback, and those who do not participate in the program and are motivated to offer vocal criticism. Dentists with no interest in Medicaid (either in support of or in opposition to) may lack motivation to respond. If that is the case, then lack of participation from these individuals is not problematic, given the survey goals.</p>
                <p>This study offers several contributions to the literature. We have demonstrated that a small monetary incentive was an effective strategy to increase response rates in a survey of dentists. Our findings updates previous research in this area, provides evidence specific to dentists, and addresses shortcomings in similar studies by including a control group and testing effects of non‐monetary incentives.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>A $2 incentive was associated with increased response rates among dentists. The magnitude of benefit is less than what has been observed among other health care providers in previous decades. However, results are consistent with the general trend of falling response rates in survey research. A non‐monetary incentive and use of first‐class postage did not affect response rates.</p>
