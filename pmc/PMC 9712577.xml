                <p id="Par1">The aim of this placebo-controlled randomized in situ study was to evaluate the effect of different surface polishing protocols on enamel roughness, bacterial adhesion and caries-protective effect of a resin infiltrant. Seventy-five bovine enamel samples having artificial caries lesions were treated with a resinous infiltrant and afterwards randomly dividided into five polishing protocols: aluminum oxide flexible disks (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks), silicon carbide tips (SIC-Tips), silicon carbide brush (SIC-Brush), silicon carbide polyester strips (SIC-Strips) or no polishing [negative control (NC)]. Average surface roughness (Ra) was assessed by profilometry. Samples were mounted in palatal appliances under a mesh for biofilm accumulation. Fifteen volunteers wore the intraoral appliances (14-days) and cariogenic challenge was triggered by sucrose solutions<bold>.</bold> Biofilm formed was collected for microbiological analysis of caries-related bacteria (<italic>Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>) and demineralization was assessed by cross-sectional microhardness. Mean Knoop hardness numbers (Kg/mm<sup>2</sup>) were plotted over lesion depth (µm) and area under the lesion curve was subtracted from sound enamel to determine demineralization (ΔS, Kg/mm<sup>2</sup>xµm). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and <italic>post-hoc</italic> comparisons (α = 0.05). NC resulted in significantly higher Ra means than Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks and SIC-Strips. Bacterial counts were not significantly different between the groups (p &gt; 0.05). Regards ΔS means, however none of the groups were significantly different to NC (6983.3 kg/mm<sup>2</sup>xµm /CI 4246.1–9720.5, p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Polishing protocols (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks, SIC-Strips) significantly decreseased roughness of infiltrated-enamel, however none of the polishing protocols could signicantly decrease bacterial counts nor resulted in significant less demineralization.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Currently a more biological approach to caries management is at least scientifically widely accepted. The understanding of caries as a multifactorial disease driven by a dysbiosis in the biofilm, the so called ecological plaque hypothesis, supports more holistic approaches for disease management including effective mechanical plaque control, diet modification and modulation of the remineralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Regarding the management of approximal non-cavitated caries lesions, the most actual consensus statements, systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommend both non- and micro-invasive treatment options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The improvement of biofilm control via oral hygiene instructions and professional fluoride application (i.e., varnish) is a main component of the non-invasive approach. For patients at low caries risk, these measures should be enough to control the disease, yet, for patients at high caries risk, a higher probability and velocity of lesion progression might be expected, and in these cases the micro-invasive treatment options, like caries sealing and caries infiltration, have been recommended<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">However up to now, not much discussion has been provided on the susceptibility of infiltrated lesions to secondary caries or lesion progression due to increased plaque stagnation. Concurrently the control of biofilm formation or the predisposition of material surfaces, such as restorations, sealants and infiltrants to accumulate biofilm is known to play a significant role in caries control. Specially as surface irregularities in materials not only predispose for higher biofilm accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but also act like niches where biofilm may grow undisturbed from mechanical actions of occlusal function, friction from cheeks, tongue, and oral hygiene measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A recent systematic review also confirms that considering composite resins polishing techniques may decrease bacterial adhesion through decrease of surface roughness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Besides surface roughness, several surface properties can influence bacterial adhesion to restorative or sealing/infiltrant materials surfaces, <italic>i.e.</italic> surface free energy (surface wettability), charge, polarity, and morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, surface roughness seems to be the most important and most studied one, especially as regards the accumulation and composition of the biofilm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, some years ago, a threshold value for average surface roughness (Ra) of 0.2 µm has been proposed, indicating that dental material surfaces with roughness means below this value should have no impact on bacterial adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, this concept has been contested recently, since the influence of roughness on bacterial adhesion seems to be more related to roughness range rather than a threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition factors like type of material and study design may also influence bacterial adhesion, with studies including formation of salivary pellicle, in situ or in vivo, having a clear advantage of better simulating the clinical conditions, where early colonizers first attach to salivary pellicle and the latter may also modify the surface of properties of the materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Incipient/white-spot carious lesions are known to show higher roughness than sound enamel, due to increased episodes of enamel dissolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and resin infiltration of these lesions indeed decreases their surface roughness. Nevertheless, infiltrated caries lesions still have significantly higher roughness than non-treated sound enamel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. After the hydrochloric acid etching, opening of the lesion micropores and the lesion body for the infiltration of low-viscosity monomers, an increased lesion surface roughness is present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The resin infiltration afterwards has been shown to effectively fill up this micro-porosities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, however without recovering of the initial roughness values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. As increased surface roughness among other factors play an important role in dental plaque accumulation and biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which in turn can favour the occurrence of caries adjacent to restorations and sealants (CARS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, this factor might be of clinical relevance for the long-term treatment survival rate. This leads to the question of, whether surface polishing procedures, a common clinical step in restorative treatment, may be also indispensable for the long-term success of caries infiltration and prevention of caries around the infiltrated lesions as well as a more holistic caries control.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Currently, only one study have investigated the influence of polishing on the recovery of enamel surface roughness after resin infiltration of incipient carious lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The polishing of infiltrated lesions, solely with one type of polishing strip showed no significant benefit regarding surface roughness and as compared to the non-polished infiltrated lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; even if the effect of the increased lesion surface roughness on bacterial adhesion was not tested. In fact, bacterial adhesion has also been tested only in one study including resin infiltration of incipient carious lesion, but without any polishing procedure after resin infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In summary there is clear evidence that resin infiltration prevents caries progression clinically, but also that it increases lesion surface roughness, which (at least in theory) favours higher plaque accumulation. Until now no clinical recommendation has been made in the current clinical guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, meta-analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and consensus reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> as regards how infiltrated approximal and buccal non-cavitated caries lesions should be polished in order to decrease surface roughness, plaque accumulation and the consequent increased risk of developing both gingivitis and secondary caries. Therefore, it is still unclear if certain polishing protocols after carious lesion infiltration with low-monomers infiltrant, could further considerably decrease enamel surface roughness as compared to non-polished infiltrated lesions and additionally decrease bacterial adhesion. Thus, the aim of this placebo-controlled randomized in situ study was to evaluate the effect of different surface polishing protocols on enamel surface roughness, bacterial adhesion and caries-protective effect of an infiltrant. It was thus hypothesized that polishing of resin-infiltrated incipient carious lesions would cause for all protocols a decrease in average surface roughness, adhesion of caries-associated bacteria and less in situ demineralization than the non-polished negative control.

              <p id="Par34">The present study evaluated for the first time the efficacy of polishing protocols after resin infiltration using an in situ model. The results showed that infiltrated and subsequently polished enamel lesions do not demineralize significantly less compared to unpolished lesions. Moreover, bacterial adhesion of caries-associated bacteria, like <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus,</italic> but also of total bacterial was not significantly reduced, partially rejecting the formulated study hypothesis. However, average surface roughness of resin-infiltrated enamel caries lesions was significantly reduced after polishing with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks and SIC-Strips confirming what was initially hypothesized; at least for these two protocols.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Currently, there are little evidence from in vitro and only limited indirect evidence from clinical studies as regards the effect of solely resin infiltration or infiltration followed by several polishing protocols on surface roughness and bacterial adhesion of infiltrated carious lesions. The significantly reduced surface roughness observed after polishing with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks and SIC-Strips are not totally in agreement with the only one in vitro study investigating polishing of resin-infiltrated lesions. In the study from Mueller, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> polishing the incipient lesions with only one type of polishing system, namely polishing strips (coarse, medium, fine and superfine, each: 15 s, total time:60 s), after light curing of the resin infiltrant resulted in average surface roughness means not significantly different to the non-polished groups. The differences in the results may be related to the fact that the caries lesions in the mentioned study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> were much deeper than in our study, implicating in the presence of much larger surface pores, which may have resulted in much higher initial surface roughness and a more difficult baseline situation for achieving a high degree of polishing. Furthermore, the study design may have been also an influence factor, as the present study the cariogenic challenge was performed in situ, including the influence of the salivary pellicle, and in the previous study only in vitro simulations were performed.</p>
              <p id="Par36">As regards the bacterial adhesion to the best of our knowledge this was the first study investigating bacterial adhesion of two caries-associated bacteria (<italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>L. acidophilus</italic>) in situ and after polishing of resin-infiltrated lesions. In fact, the only previous study investigating bacterial adhesion after a resin infiltration procedure, did not included any polishing afterwards, while investigating only one bacteria species, namely <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this way the approaches are not directly comparable, but anyway also without polishing there was a slightly reduced adhesion of <italic>S. mutans</italic>, which was not significantly different to the non-treated control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This indicates a tendency towards absence of an impact of resin infiltration on biofilm formation. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the influence of resin infiltration on bacterial adhesion is still needed and must be further investigated. Moreover, the present results must be interpreted with caution as other cariogenic species play a key role in a cariogenic biofilm or in the transition to dysbiosis of the microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Another aspect interest to observe is that even in the groups causing a significant decrease in surface roughness, like Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks and SIC-Strips, this decrease was not accompanied by a decrease in the bacterial adhesion over these more polished surfaces. This was somehow unexpected, but at the same time shows that surface roughness is not the solely topography parameter impacting bacterial adhesion. Indeed, also surface free energy, charge, polarity and morphology has been shown to substantially influence bacterial adhesion and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, the means of average surface roughness (Ra) in the present study varied from 0.3 to 0.6 µm, slightly above a limit of 0.2 µm, over which surfaces were supposed to favour higher bacterial adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This is also in agreement with a recent systematic review contesting this threshold value for bacterial adhesion over dental material surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition factors like type of material and study design may also influence bacterial adhesion, with studies including formation of salivary pellicle<italic>, </italic>in situ or in vivo, having a clear advantage of better simulating the clinical conditions, where early colonizers first attach to salivary pellicle and the latter may also modify the surface of properties of the materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par38">It can be speculated that one of the reasons for the absence of influence of surface roughness on bacterial adhesion in the present study may be related to the presence of a naturally formed salivary pellicle over the enamel surfaces. Since there is evidence that the presence of the pellicle may level out grooves and valleys of a rough enamel surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, bacterial adhesion to dental and material surfaces is a complex multi-stage process, which is up to now not completely understood. There is only a clear understanding that surface topography may influence the near-surface micro-environment and therefore plays a important role in bacterial adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, future investigations could systematically evaluate also other topographic parameters for improving the understanding of the biofilm-surface interactions.</p>
              <p id="Par39">For sure the use of bovine enamel samples provides similar but not equal demineralization responses as human enamel and thus represent a limitation of the results shown. However, at the same time, the study design allowed for the first time an analysis of the influence of polishing of resin-infiltrated incipient caries lesions on surface roughness, bacterial adhesion, and the caries protective effect within the oral cavity and under cariogenic conditions. This represents an important advantage of the model as, among other reasons, it is well known that bacterial growth over enamel or restoration surfaces in highly influenced by the presence or absence of a naturally formed salivary pellicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Thus, a better clinical simulation of the biofilm film formed clinically was achieved. Nonetheless, the clinical efficacy of polishing resin-infiltrated caries lesions must still be investigated under a more severe cariogenic model, including longer sucrose challenges and/or longer periods in situ<italic>.</italic></p>
              <p id="Par40">Furthermore, the comparative effectiveness of the resin infiltrate against newly introduced treatments for arresting or remineralizing carious white-spot lesions, like the biomimetic approaches using hydroxyapatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and self-assembling peptide P11-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> therapies should be further investigated in the future. Both in relation to their remineralizing and their effects on enamel surface properties as well as bacterial colonization.</p>
              <p id="Par41">As regards the methods used, it is important to notice that cross-sectional microhardness is also a wide-used and valid method of measuring changes in enamel mineral content (i.e. demineralization). The reason for that is because a linear correlation between values of cross-sectional microhardness and volume mineral loss (%vol x µm) has been demonstrated both in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> as in situ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Transversal microradiography is the current gold standard technique, and this clear correlation indicates that cross-sectional microhardness is a sensitive and reliable method for assessing mineral loss of incipient carious lesions. As regards the microbial counts through cultivation methods and counting of colony forming units, it is reasonable to say that although currently more modern molecular biological methods are available, for several research questions the classic cultivation methods still provide very useful information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. As both microorganisms tested here grow well in the cultivation plates and the microbiological analyses were just an ancillary method in the current work, it surely fulfilled the nees. For future studies it might be interesting though to include also other analyses like fluorescence microscopy or investigations of the 16S rRNA gene.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Although the present results showed that polishing neither influenced the caries-protective effect of resin infiltration nor the bacterial adhesion, from a clinical point of view and specially for labial white-spot lesions infiltrated for masking the whitish appearance, it is still probably more reasonable to polish then anyway. Data from previous clinical studies on this application showed that labial lesions may suffer from long-term staining, when not polished<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, contrary to the clinical studies on approximal lesions, which all did not report polishing procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, for labial lesions most of the clinical studies have been performed including polishing steps after light curing of the infiltrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In the study from Kobbe et al. 2019 for example polishing with disks (Sof-Lex) and a polishing brush (Okklubrush) were included and resulted in non-staining in the short-term follow-up.</p>
              <p id="Par43">It was shown for the first time in a pre-clinical intraoral model that some polishing protocols influenced surface roughness, while not significantly affecting neither bacterial adhesion nor enamel demineralization, under the conditions of this study. In this way, not contradicting the clinical recommendation of only removing surplus infiltrant material before light curing. However, one must bear in mind that this question of plaque stagnation over resin-infiltrated should be further investigated either in vivo or with in situ models including longer and more aggressive cariogenic challenges as well as including other polishing protocols before a clinical recommendation as regards the polishing need after infiltration of both buccal as well as approximal caries lesions can be made.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Thus, in conlcusion polishing protocols including Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Disks and SIC-strips significantly decreased average roughness of resin-infiltrated caries lesions in enamel. However, none of the polishing protocols could significantly decrease the bacterial counts nor resulted in significantly less demineralization than the non-polished control. From a clinical point of view and specially for labial white-spot lesions infiltrated for masking the whitish appearance, it is still probably more reasonable to polish then anyway.</p>
