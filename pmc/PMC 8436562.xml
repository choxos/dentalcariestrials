                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">This examiner-blind, stratified, parallel study aimed to evaluate the anti-gingivitis efficacy of a non-aqueous (anhydrous) 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride toothpaste (‘Test’) versus a sodium monofluorophosphate toothpaste (‘Control’) in people with clinically-confirmed mild-moderate gingivitis. Plaque-induced gingivitis can progress to irreversible periodontitis if left untreated. This can be controlled by an effective oral hygiene regimen such as one including toothbrushing with a toothpaste containing the chemotherapeutic agent stannous fluoride. Long-term studies over 4–12 weeks have shown the efficacy of stannous fluoride; however, shorter term studies are needed to examine if the effects on measures of gingivitis and plaque control occur sooner.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Eligible participants were randomised to 3 weeks’ twice-daily brushing (for 1 min) with Test or Control toothpastes. The primary efficacy variable was between-treatment difference in Bleeding Index (BI) at 3 weeks; secondary variables were between-treatment differences in number of bleeding sites, modified Gingival Index (MGI), and Turesky modification of the Quigley–Hein Plaque Index (TPI) at Weeks 2 and 3.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">A statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) lower BI score was reported for Test (n = 65) versus Control (n = 65) groups at Week 2 (mean difference: − 0.07 [95% CI − 0.9, − 0.05]; 32.7% difference) and Week 3 (mean difference: − 0.06 [95% CI − 0.8, − 0.04]; 29.2% difference). The Test group also demonstrated statistically significant lower (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 versus Control) number of bleeding sites (Weeks 2/3 mean difference [95% CI]: − 10.04 [− 12.3, − 7.5]/ − 8.2 [− 11.1, − 5.3] sites; 33.0%/29.3% difference); MGI score (Weeks 2/3 mean difference [95% CI]: − 0.09 [− 0.13, − 0.06]/ − 0.10 [− 0.14, − 0.06]; 4.3%/4.7% difference); overall TPI score (Weeks 2/3 mean difference [95% CI]: − 0.45 [− 0.55, − 0.35/ − 0.42 [− 0.53, − 0.30] difference; 16.0%/15.1% difference) and interproximal TPI score (Weeks 2/3 mean difference [95% CI]: − 0.42 [− 0.52, − 0.30]/ − 0.41 [− 0.52, − 0.29]; 14.6%/14.1% difference). Both toothpastes were generally well tolerated.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Three weeks’ twice-daily brushing with the 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride Test toothpaste compared to the Control toothpaste led to statistically significant lower gingival bleeding, gingival inflammation and plaque levels in adults with mild-moderate gingivitis. These results indicate that plaque and gingivitis-reducing benefits of 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride may be seen from 2 weeks’ use.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">While gingivitis, an inflammatory response to dental plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is a reversible condition, it can progress to irreversible periodontitis if left untreated, eventually leading to tissue, tooth and bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The maintenance of gingival health is therefore paramount as, currently, periodontitis is reported to affect 5% to 20% of the world’s population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Gingivitis can be prevented and resolved through effective plaque control, primarily via the mechanical removal of plaque by toothbrushing. Where adequate plaque control cannot be achieved by such means, this can be augmented with the use of antimicrobial agents in oral healthcare products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Accordingly, antimicrobial agents such as metal salts, cetylpyridinium chloride and chlorhexidine have been included in daily use toothpastes and mouth rinse formulations for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These complement mechanical plaque removal by inhibiting the growth of bacteria (via bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal activity) in the areas of dentition less accessible to the toothbrush and by interfering with re-colonisation of plaque bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">In this study, a toothpaste containing the antimicrobial agent stannous fluoride (SnF<sub>2</sub>) was investigated due to the antimicrobial properties of stannous ions (Sn [II]), which have been shown to reduce bacterial biomass/virulence and inhibit bacterial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This action is supported by numerous clinical studies where the anti-gingivitis/anti-plaque efficacy of 0.4% to 0.454% w/w SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpastes has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], including studies where an anhydrous formulation, which aids SnF<sub>2</sub> stability within the toothpaste, is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These previous studies have investigated the efficacy of the 0.454% w/w SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste at time-points ranging from 4 to 24 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, it is of interest to understand if this efficacy can be seen at earlier timepoints.</p>
              <p id="Par9">This study evaluated the anti-gingivitis efficacy, following dental prophylaxis, of an anhydrous 0.454% w/w SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste after 2 and 3 weeks twice-daily brushing for 1 timed minute. Efficacy was compared to a negative control toothpaste containing sodium monofluorophosphate. The primary objective was evaluation of clinical efficacy as measured by the Bleeding Index (BI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] after 3 weeks’ use. Secondary objectives included BI at 2 weeks and number of bleeding sites, modified Gingival Index (MGI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Plaque Index scores (TPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] after 2 and 3 weeks’ use.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par10">This was a 3 week, randomised, stratified, examiner-blind, two-treatment, parallel-group clinical trial performed at a clinical study centre in Las Vegas, USA. The study was carried out in full compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, all applicable local good clinical practice regulations and participant privacy requirements and the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The final study protocol, informed consent forms and all other information that required pre-approval were reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IntegReview IRB, Austin, Texas, USA. IRB number: IRB00003657/IORG0000689).

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par11">Eligible participants provided written informed consent before study procedures commenced. Eligibility included having mild-moderate plaque-induced gingivitis, as confirmed by visual examination by a single investigator, and being aged 18 to 65 years and in good health with no significant/relevant medical or oral/dental conditions. Participants needed to have at least 20 natural teeth, with ≥ 40 surfaces gradable by the clinical indices used in the study. Excluded teeth included third molars and any with gross caries, calculus, orthodontic bands/bonds, crowns or extensive restoration. At baseline examination, eligibility included a mean whole mouth MGI score of between 1.75–2.30, a mean overall TPI score of ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 20 bleeding sites.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Participants with any medical condition or those who were taking any medications that could affect gingival condition/bleeding were excluded. This included those with current or within 14 d of baseline use of any antibacterial mouthwash or oral care product, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory or anti-coagulant medications, or any other systemic medication. Additional medical exclusion criteria included: current smoker, or who had stopped within 6 months of screening; current user of any smokeless form of tobacco; pregnancy; breast feeding; tongue/lip piercing; intolerance/hypersensitivity to study materials or participation in another clinical trial within 30 d of screening. Dental exclusion criteria included: periodontitis and/or periodontal treatment within 12 m of screening; partial/full dentures and teeth whitening treatment or dental prophylaxis within 12 w of screening.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Study visits and clinical procedures</title>
                <p id="Par13">At screening (Visit 1), participants’ demographics and medical history were recorded, followed by an oral examination including gingival assessment. Eligible participants were instructed to continue brushing using their usual toothpaste and routine until the baseline visit (Visit 2), which occurred 1–28 d after Visit 1. On the evening before the baseline visit, participants abstained from oral hygiene procedures, allowing for 10–18 h plaque accumulation prior to their study centre visit. At Visit 2, a single dental examiner performed a full oral soft tissue (OST) examination, then assessments of gingival inflammation (MGI), gingival bleeding (BI), and supra-gingival plaque (TPI) were conducted.</p>
                <p id="Par14">For the MGI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], assessment was carried out for each scorable tooth at the gingival margin and interdental papillae of the lingual and buccal surfaces. Each surface was scored on a 5-point scale from 0 (absence of inflammation) to 4 (severe inflammation) with MGI calculated as the mean score of all scored tooth sites.</p>
                <p id="Par15">For each scorable tooth, bleeding was assessed on both lingual and facial gingival surfaces. Three scores (distal, body, mesial sites) were recorded lingually/palatally and three buccally/labially. Bleeding was scored as 0 (no bleeding after 30 s), 1 (bleeding on probing after 30 s) or 2 (immediate bleeding on probing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] with a site considered as ‘bleeding’ if the BI score was 1 or 2. For each participant, overall BI score was calculated by adding up the number of all individual bleeding sites scored and dividing by the number of sites assessed.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Plaque was disclosed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Trace<sup>®</sup> Solution; Young Dental, Earth City, MO, USA) then was assessed using the TPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] on mesial, distal and mid sites of lingual and buccal surfaces of each gradable tooth. Plaque presence was scored on a 6-point scale from 0 (no plaque) to 5 (plaque covering two-thirds or more of tooth crown).

A sufficient number of participants were to be screened to randomise approximately 130 (65 per group), to ensure 60 evaluable participants per group completed the study. With this number per group, it was estimated to detect a 0.1 difference in BI (standard deviation [SD] = 0.17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with 90% power and a 2-sided 5% significance level. This would represent approximately a 23% difference between study product groups. This estimate allowed detection of a 5% difference in a key secondary variable, MGI, with 90% power.

              <p id="Par32">The results of this study indicate a difference in adjusted mean scores between the Test and Control groups with regard to BI score, number of bleeding sites, MGI score and overall and interproximal TPI scores. This was shown at both Weeks 2 and 3, all in favour of the Test group.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Examination of gingival bleeding on probing as an indication of gingival inflammation is important as maintenance of periodontal and gingival health can be predicted by a low number of bleeding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The effects of SnF<sub>2</sub> containing toothpastes on gingivitis have been described in several other clinical studies and reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; however, many of these were carried out over long time periods such as 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">It has long been reported that recordable gingival health benefits of chemotherapeutic containing toothpastes may be feasible after 2 to 3 weeks of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This is confirmed in this current study with results showing significant differences in BI and number of bleeding sites between the SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste and the Control at both 2 and 3 weeks. These findings are consistent with prior studies with a similar SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste over longer time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, interim results of a 12 week study of a similar toothpaste showed that on examination at Week 4, there were also significant differences, and similar percentage changes, in BI (33.4%) and number of bleeding sites (33.5%) to the findings of this current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that, following a prophylaxis, twice daily use of the SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste resulted in a clinically meaningful early and sustained decrease in gingival bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">Few other trials have looked at these early timepoints; however, those that have, albeit with procedural differences, concur with the results shown here. For instance, a recent study of a variety of SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste formulations used over 12 weeks had an interim assessment of 2 weeks and also found a significant reduction in number of bleeding sites and gingival index scores at this timepoint. Of note though, this study did not have participants undergo a prophylaxis prior to study toothpaste use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">To separate the mechanical effects of toothbrushing and the SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste, another study had participants use a slurry containing either 0.45% w/w SnF<sub>2</sub> or a control toothpaste without any active anti-gingivitis ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Following prophylaxis, gingival bleeding and gingivitis scores were significantly higher with the control toothpaste after 3 weeks use, showing that, independent of brushing, SnF<sub>2</sub> is effective for maintenance of gingival health.</p>
              <p id="Par37">While early achievement of low bleeding scores following prophylaxis may be achievable with a SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste, resolution of gingival inflammation may take longer. In this study, for the MGI scores, reduction from baseline for both study products and the difference between them were lower compared to those of other variables. This was also seen in the previous 12 week study, where MGI similarly showed only a small, though statistically significant, difference at Week 4 (5.4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">This current study also looked at plaque indices as gingivitis develops when plaque elicits a local inflammatory response in the gingivae at the site of its accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is well established that gingivitis can be prevented and resolved through effective plaque control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. SnF<sub>2</sub> has been shown to exert its plaque control effects via control of microbiome metabolism, which can limit occurrence of inflammatory products that can cause gingival inflammation, such as endotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Here, dental prophylaxis followed by twice daily brushing resulted in reduction of plaque by 16.0% at Week 2 and 15.1% at Week 3. Toothbrushing alone may not reach all parts of the tooth, therefore interproximal plaque scores were of interest as well and a difference was found between the two groups, favouring the SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste (14.6%/14.1% by Weeks 2/3). The studies of this toothpaste at later timepoints (12 and 24 weeks), found similar, sustained differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This again suggests, as discussed above, that SnF<sub>2</sub> has a reach beyond that of mechanical toothbrushing.</p>
              <p id="Par39">To assess whether differences in plaque control between SnF<sub>2</sub> formulations and controls were due to the prophylaxis step, a previous study used a ‘split mouth’ design and had participants brushing with a control toothpaste for 3 weeks while using either a SnF<sub>2</sub> or control mouthrinse. This study found significant differences in plaque levels between groups after 1 and 3 weeks on both the side of the mouth that had undergone prophylaxis and the non-professionally cleaned side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This indicates that SnF<sub>2</sub> formulations can be useful for both plaque reduction when a prophylaxis isn’t carried out, and inhibition of plaque formation when such a prophylaxis is administered, as found in this current study.</p>
              <p id="Par40">One limitation of this study was that the BI, MGI and TPI scoring systems depend on examiner judgement. While repeatability was deemed ‘excellent,’ further studies could include less subjective analysis of indices of gingival inflammation such as measures of cytokines and galectins in saliva, serum or tissue. Such studies that have been carried out indicate a relationship between clinically measurable inflammatory factors and periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Both study toothpastes were generally well tolerated with few adverse events reported, all mild, that had resolved by the end of the study.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par41">In conclusion, this investigation supports the clinical efficacy and tolerability of an anhydrous 0.454% w/w SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste in improving gingival health and shows that gingivitis and plaque control can be shown from as early as 2 weeks following prophylaxis. Although the differences in the gingivitis indices were significantly greater for the 0.454% w/w SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste compared to control, these differences in MGI may not necessarily be clinically relevant at the early timepoints.</p>
