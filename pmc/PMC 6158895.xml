                  <p id="Par1">Dental caries is the most prominent childhood disease in the world. In the United States, more than 50% of children have experienced caries. Untreated caries can have negative impacts on quality of life, academic performance, and school attendance. To reduce oral health disparities, multiple organizations recommend school-based caries prevention.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A longitudinal, cluster randomized, non-inferiority trial will be conducted in low-income children from primarily Hispanic/Latino backgrounds currently enrolled in public elementary schools in New York City, New York, United States, from 2018 to 2023. The primary objective is to compare the non-inferiority of silver diamine fluoride and fluoride varnish versus glass ionomer therapeutic sealants and fluoride varnish in the arrest and prevention of dental caries. Secondary objectives are to evaluate differences in effectiveness when care is provided by nurses versus dental hygienists and assess the impact of prevention on oral health-related quality of life and educational outcomes. Caries arrest will be evaluated after 2 years, and caries prevention and secondary outcomes will be assessed at the completion of the study. Data analysis will follow intent-to-treat, and statistical analyses will be conducted using a two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The comparative effectiveness of alternative caries prevention delivery models is considered to be one of the highest research priorities in the United States. Many treatments are currently available to prevent and arrest dental caries. The simplicity and affordability of silver diamine fluoride may be a viable alternative for the prevention of dental caries in high-risk children.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par16">Dental caries (tooth decay) is a natural process in which bacteria in the biofilm cause fluctuations in pH that can lead to an erosion of dental hard tissues and result in visible lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and is the most prevalent childhood disease in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Untreated dental caries affects more than 20% of elementary school-aged children in the United States, and over 50% of children have ever experienced caries. For low-income and minority-group children, caries experience can exceed 70% and the prevalence of untreated caries is greater than 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Persistent untreated dental caries in children can lead to pulpal involvement and abscess, and contributes to oral pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In 2017, a comprehensive review of dental caries concluded that though the overall prevalence of caries has decreased worldwide, the burden of disease is still significant across all age groups and is most prominent among low-income populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Poor oral health can have negative long-term impacts on quality of life, school attendance, and academic performance. Research has consistently showed that caries experience negatively affects oral health-related quality of life across multiple age groups, socioeconomic levels, and children from different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Further, children with dental caries and associated toothache have been shown to have increased absenteeism and reduced academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Notably, children with caries who received dental care had significant improvement in their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Low-income and minority-group children face profound oral health inequities. Lower dental service utilization is found among low-income and minority-group families, and the bulk of services received focused on treating existing issues while neglecting preventive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, sealant use is lowest in low-income children and few of these children reported visiting a dentist in the previous year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Typically, it is children most at risk of oral diseases who lack access to preventive services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and many traditional office-based dentists do not provide preventive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To address this unmet need, multiple organizations and institutions recommend school-based caries prevention programs as a supplement to traditional care in order to increase access to dental services and reduce oral health inequities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Among the many treatments available to arrest and/or prevent dental caries, leading options include water fluoridation, fluoride toothpaste, fluoride varnish, sealants and/or interim therapeutic restorations (ITR), and silver diamine fluoride (SDF), each of which has been shown to have varying levels of efficacy in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">The Institute of Medicine considers the study of caries-prevention models to be a “high priority” topic in comparative effectiveness research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition to the potential differences in mode of delivery (e.g., mobile dental vans versus school-based oral health clinics), the impact of alternative primary and/or secondary caries prevention agents when used in pragmatic settings is largely unknown. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of research on the potential impact of caries prevention on subsequent quality of life and educational performance. We present a longitudinal, cluster randomized, non-inferiority trial designed to compare two packages of treatments with both primary and secondary caries prevention agents: a “simple” prevention package consisting of fluoride varnish and SDF and a “complex” package consisting of fluoride varnish, sealants, and ITR. The primary outcomes of the trial are caries arrest and caries prevention. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, academic performance, and school absences. Additionally, the comparative effectiveness of simple prevention when provided by dental hygienists versus school nurses will be assessed. The primary population is low-income Hispanic/Latino children who attend elementary schools in an urban school district, known to be one of the highest-need oral health populations in the region. It is hypothesized that simple caries prevention is non-inferior to complex care.</p>

              <p id="Par20">This is a longitudinal, pragmatic, cluster randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial consisting of SDF combined with fluoride varnish versus therapeutic sealants with fluoride varnish given biannually to each study participant in primary schools. This trial is reported following the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines and has received approval from the New York University (NYU) School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) (#i17–00578). Any changes to the study protocol will be communicated to the IRB and funder in quarterly reports, and investigators will cooperate with any independent audit on behalf of the IRB or funding organization.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Prior to the study, schools meeting the inclusion criteria will be solicited for participation and randomly assigned to receive fluoride varnish/SDF or fluoride varnish/sealants in 6-month intervals (± 1 month). Informed consent for all children in participating schools will be distributed to parents at the beginning of each school year. At each observational period, study participants with completed consent will receive a comprehensive oral examination provided by a licensed dental hygienist and complete a brief psychological assessment for oral health-related quality of life (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Following the oral evaluation, participants will receive the assigned treatments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design, enrollment, and data collection</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2891_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par22">The primary aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of SDF versus sealants in the arrest and prevention of dental caries. Secondary study aims include assessing differences in provider type, quality of life, academic performance, and school attendance. To determine provider effects, treatments in the simple prevention group will be given by either dental hygienists or registered dental nurses and the rates of arrest and prevention will be compared across provider. Data for educational outcomes will be solicited from the New York City (NYC) Department of Education (DOE). Any participant presenting with a medical emergency will be referred to school nurses for follow-up care. The anticipated schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2891_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par23">At each observation for each participant, examining dentists will dry tooth surfaces with gauze squares and perform full-mouth oral examinations, including examination of all teeth and tooth surfaces to determine if sound, decayed, missing, filled, or having pulpal involvement. The exam will also include an assessment of pain, swelling, infection, and abscess presence.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Diagnosis of cavitated carious lesions will be made based on a visual-tactile oral examination and follow criteria for cavitated lesions as specified by the <italic>Diagnostic Criteria and Procedures</italic> of the Oral Health Surveys of the National Institute of Dental Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p>
                <p id="Par25">Examiners will be calibrated by examining ten students independently at baseline and discussing whether caries are present or not. Following this review, examiners will be calibrated by examining another ten students independently and comparing results. To standardized delivery of care, examiners will be trained to use all interventions prior to participating in the study. Standardization of diagnostic criteria will consist of reviewing diagnoses at the mid-point of each study year and discussing with examiners. Both calibration and standardization will be conducted every year of the study.</p>
                <p id="Par26">Treatments in the complex arm will be provided by dental hygienists with the support of dental assistants. Treatments in the simple arm will be provided by registered nurses or dental hygienists with the support of dental assistants, both overseen by a nurse practitioner.</p>

The potential risks for study participants are minimal and identical to the risk for children obtaining care in a dental office. The greatest risk is an allergic reaction to fluoride varnish, SDF, or glass ionomer. All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded: at each contact with the study participant, investigators will seek information on adverse events by specific questions and an oral examination. Evidence of adverse events will be recorded on electronic health records and appropriate case report forms. The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that participation in the study was not the cause. Serious adverse events ongoing at study end will be followed to determine the final outcome. Adverse event reports will be reported to the IRB within five working days from the time that investigators become aware of the event.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p id="Par42">The presented study is powered for the primary outcomes of caries arrest and prevention. Approximately 14,100 students are expected to be enrolled across 60 schools over the duration of the study (<italic>n</italic> = 235 per school cluster). Based on a pilot study of school-based caries prevention conducted in NYC from 2016 to 2017, the baseline prevalence of caries of the primary and permanent dentition at the child level was 40.7%. The prevalence of untreated decay on primary dentition only was 36.4%, and the prevalence of untreated decay on permanent dentition only was 35.1%. The average dmft was 1.40 (SD = 2.04) and the average DMFT was 0.34 (SD = 0.84). Power for the primary outcome of caries arrest was calculated using a two-arm non-inferiority trial design. The per-person proportion of carious teeth at baseline that were treated with complex or simple prevention and stayed arrested over a 2-year period will be analyzed at the child level. Calculations assume an equal proportion of success, <italic>π</italic>, of teeth with caries being arrested in complex and simple arms. The non-inferiority margin (<italic>δ</italic>) was set at 10%. Additional parameters of a two-sided type-I error rate of 5% and statistical power of 0.80 yielded a total sample size per group of 198 (<italic>n</italic><sub>tot</sub> = 396) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. To adjust for any potential school-level clustering based on inclusion criteria of schools consisting of high-need children, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.10 was assumed. The design effect associated with this ICC increased the effective sample size by a factor of 24.5, resulting in a total required sample of 9702.</p>
                <p id="Par43">For caries prevention, power for the two-arm, longitudinal, cluster randomized design was estimated using the method of Diggle et al. (2002) for generalized estimating equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Estimates assume an average number of visits per child of six, statistical power of 0.80, and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%. A repeated measures correlation of 0.5 and a per-visit attrition rate of 20% were also assumed. For a given minimally detectable effect size (standardized effect size difference) of 0.25, a cluster-adjusted (ICC = 0.10) sample size of 12,874 is required. Based on the expected participant enrollment, the study is powered for these conservative assumptions for caries prevention.</p>
                <p id="Par44">For secondary outcomes, the NYC citywide average absenteeism rate is 14.2%. The average performances for reading and math examinations (grades 3–5) are 298 (SD = 17) and 299 (SD = 21), respectively. Sample sizes were calculated using a simple two-group cluster randomized comparison of means (standardized test performance) and proportions (school absences). Power calculations assume an intraclass correlation of 10%, statistical power of 0.80, and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%. Based on these assumptions, the anticipated sample size is sufficient to detect a 9% decrease in absenteeism (to 5%) and a standardized test difference of 6.44 (reading) and 7.95 (math).</p>
                <p id="Par45">Quality of life will be measured using the short form version of the Child Oral Health Impact Profile (COHIP-SF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In a validation study of the COHIP-SF, a pediatric sample of children (aged 7–17 years) had average scores of 56.2 (SD = 9.3). For a simple cluster randomized, two-group mean comparison, with a two-sided type I error rate of 5%, statistical power of 0.80, and ICC of 0.10, the study is powered to detect a difference of 2.2 on the COHIP-SF scale.</p>

Any deciduous teeth with treated carious lesions that are lost due to exfoliation during the course of the study will be considered as arrested throughout the observed lifetime of the tooth. Data will record the last observed status of exfoliated teeth to be used in subsequent analyses. Thus, tooth-level indicators are able to be present for both primary and permanent dentitions at the same time. With this approach, each carious tooth treated with either simple or comprehensive prevention is a single trial with outcomes either of arrested (1) or failed to arrest (0).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par56">Due to the considerable oral health needs of high-risk children resulting from access barriers to traditional office-based care, school-based caries prevention programs have become a popular public health dentistry intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The vast majority of these programs use dental sealants as the primary preventive agent, though others include fluoride varnish and ITR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Despite a growing interest in SDF to arrest and prevent caries in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], to our knowledge they have never been used in school-based prevention programs in the United States. Given the economic benefits of SDF and because they can be provided to patients much faster than traditional sealants, demonstrating the non-inferiority of SDF compared to traditional sealants in the arrest and prevention of caries has the potential to drastically alter the landscape of school-based oral health care.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Research has shown that tooth decay is responsible for negative effects on oral health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as reported by both children who experienced decay and their caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and is also associated with functional limitations as measured by different OHRQoL scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, poor oral health can directly lower school performance in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and result in increased absenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], either directly through oral pain or through reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. For example, one study has shown that children with toothache are four times as likely to have a low grade-point average, and dental health issues were responsible for 35% of a child’s missed school days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This suggests that improving oral health can directly impact educational outcomes. The presented clinical trial will thus additionally evaluate differences between caries prevention agents on key domains of quality of life, particularly oral health, functional well-being, and socio-emotional well-being, as well as academic performance and school attendance.</p>
              <p id="Par58">This study will be conducted in parallel with a companion trial of SDF versus traditional sealants in schools in New Hampshire, with notable differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The primary study population for the presented trial is low-income urban Hispanic/Latino children with access to fluoridated water, though enrollment is open to all children regardless of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. In contrast, the companion study will recruit primarily low-income white rural children without access to water fluoridation. Additionally, this latter trial will also determine the cost-effectiveness of simple versus complex prevention, while the former includes oral health-related quality of life, academic performance, and school attendance outcomes. Finally, the presented study will include a comparison of the effectiveness of SDF when applied by school nurses versus dental hygienists. Following primary analyses, the proportion of caries arrested and the rate of new caries observed will be compared between children who received simple prevention from a school nurse and children who received simple prevention from a dental hygienist. Importantly, the simplicity of applying SDF means that if similarly effective, the existing registered nurse workforce present in schools can easily provide preventive oral health care.</p>
              <p id="Par59">The direct benefit anticipated for participating children includes improved oral health, positive increases in quality of life, and improved school attendance and performance. Due to the minimally invasive nature of experimental interventions, no additional risks are expected. This study could lead to broader utilization, provided by existing school nurses, of SDF in schools.</p>
