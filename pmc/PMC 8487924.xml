                  <p id="Par2">Twenty edentulous sites of systemically and periodontally healthy individuals were allocated into two groups in this prospective, two-armed, randomized double-blinded clinical trial in 1:1 ratio, wherein each site received laser-microgrooved implants with either laser-microgrooved or machined prosthetic abutments. Outcome measures included full-mouth plaque (FMPS%) and bleeding score (FMBS%), site-specific plaque (SPS%) and bleeding score (SBS%), peri-implant sulcus depth (PISD mm), and mean crestal bone loss (MCBL mm) evaluated at baseline (6 weeks), 1 and 3 years post-early loading. Mean and standard deviation of all parameters were estimated, between groups and at different time points using independent and paired <italic>t</italic>-test, respectively, Normality was checked using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and Shapiro–Wilk test, <italic>P</italic> value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par12">The laudative success of the principle behind ‘Osseointegration’ is being utilized across the world of dentistry in the expanding use of dental implants, to skilfully rehabilitate edentulous spaces. The principle of osseointegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] has been shown to provide successful anchorage to root analogues that are fused to the alveolar ridge, providing fixed replacement of missing teeth that fulfill the functional and aesthetic requirements of patients. However crestal bone loss seems to occur as a concurrent phenomenon post-implant placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] which has been attributed to the ingress of bacteria to the implant–abutment junction causing peri-implant inflammation which later leads to loss of supporting tissues eventually resulting in peri-implantitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The initial loss of crestal bone termed as early implant bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] is a phenomenon defined as the breakdown of the implant–tissue interface beginning at the crestal region in successfully integrated implants that is noted during the first year of prosthetic loading occurring within 1-year post-loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, there is lack of unanimity as to the cause of this type of early loss of bone in the loaded implant.</p>
              <p id="Par13">A myriad of research work have been conducted to understand the “Causa Causans” for this observed early implant bone loss. In vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have demonstrated that surface micro-grooves on the cervical portion of the implant and abutment with a specific shape and depth promote osteoblast and fibroblast proliferation toward the grooves. Thus in order to decrease crestal bone loss around implants, establishing a stable soft tissue seal around the implant abutment interface is necessary in order to ensure prevention of bacterial colonization, and thereby decreasing crestal bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Laser-microgrooved implants have been documented in the recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with improved efficacy in relation to connective tissue attachment and prevention of crestal bone resorption. The concept suggested was that, a direct fibro-collagenous attachment to the implant–abutment complex ensured a direct connective tissue attachment to the altered abutment surface which showed prevention of premature crestal bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further laser peening, resulted in grooving of the implant and the abutment surfaces, thus favoring the physical attachment of connective tissue to the grooves hence forming a fibrous capsule arrangement perpendicular to the implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Studies on laser-microgrooved implants have been very negligible and thus the need for an extensive research on the same is a mandate to expand the research in implant dentistry.</p>
              <p id="Par15">In this study, we try to compare the efficacy of laser-microgrooved implants and laser-microgrooved abutments with laser-microgrooved implants and machined abutments in terms of peri-implant soft tissue and hard tissue healing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to compare the laser-microgrooved implants with two different types of abutment connections with a 3-year follow-up.</p>

                <title>Primary outcome</title>
                <p id="Par18">The primary outcomes included site-specific plaque score (SPS), site-specific sulcular bleeding score (SBS), peri-implant sulcus depth (PISD) measured from the gingival margin to the base of the sulcus, radiographic parameter—mean crestal bone loss measured from the level of the implant abutment junction to the crest of the alveolar bone. The mean crestal bone loss was evaluated using digital radiographic assessment involving the employment of photo-stimulable phosphor plates (PSP), an X-ray positioning device and holding device. The X-ray positioning and holding device was provided with a bite plane where the patient bites at centric relationship and was recorded, with a poly-vinyl siloxane material (heavy body impression material). A guiding arm attached to the X-ray positioning and holding device facilitated reproduction of the position of the tube head, with the same horizontal and vertical angulations, thereby standardizing the radiographic image. The PSP plates were mounted on the X-ray positioning and holding device and radiographs were obtained. Later the PSP were scanned using DIGORA software (DIGORA—the SOREDEX DIGORA is a system that scans imaging plates automatically, with optimized images and displayed on the screen in seconds.) and digital images were obtained. Digital grids were superimposed on the radiographic image using the SOPRO (SOPRO—is a digital imaging software used for creating database of the image). Initially a horizontal line was created to overlap the implant abutment junction after which, a vertical line perpendicular to the implant abutment junction line, passing at the center of the apex of the implant at the mid-axis level was generated. Two parallel lines to the mid-axis line were then produced—one from the mesial aspect and the other from the distal aspect of the implant. Both these lines were spaced 0.1 mm away from the crest module on the implant abutment junction line to the crest of the alveolar bone. The dimensions of these lines were used to measure the crestal bone loss immediately after restoration (baseline), at 1 year and 3 years post-restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

The allocation of the treatment for each patient was done on a random basis with 1:1 allocation ratio, with edentulous sites being serially recruited and assigned with numbers according to their enrollment in the study. The odd numbers were considered as the control group with patients receiving laser-microgrooved implants followed by loading with regular machined abutments and the even numbers were considered as the test group with patients receiving laser-microgrooved implants followed by loading with laser-microgrooved abutments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). All the implants were placed by a single calibrated surgeon who after placing the implants was given the serially placed envelope to decide what abutments the patient would receive.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Prosthetic abutments used for loading. <bold>a</bold> Regular Machined abutments, <bold>b</bold> Laser microgrooved abutments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40729_2021_382_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par38">Restoration of the lost tooth using implant supported prosthesis has become a widely accepted modality of treatment in Dentistry. The general clinical assumption is that surgical trauma, and subsequent bone drilling might result in bone loss around the cervical regions of the implant leading to “saucerization” beginning from the neck of the implant and later extending apically to the first thread and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. With the significant success rates to the osseo-integrated implants, Clinicians are now focussed on options that would produce optimal aesthetic and functional results and therefore left to ponder if this observed post-restorative dieback of bone could be conquered, to enable success that would be compounded by functional and aesthetic values.</p>
              <p id="Par39">As a matter of fact, bacterial invasion at the trans-mucosal region is one of the most critical problems associated with long-term maintenance of the crestal bone levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Concerns of a possible bacterial colonization of the implant–abutment micro gap within the biological width has led clinicians to work on micro and macro design changes which could promote a soft tissue interface on the abutment, thus minimizing crestal bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">In this study the FMPS% and FMBS% scores taken at baseline, 1 year and 3 years post-early loading had no statistical significant difference (<italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.88 and &lt; 0.41, respectively) between the control and the test group which correlates to the fact that the patients in both the groups, were well motivated and they maintained appropriate plaque control measures throughout the study.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Ericsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] in his study quantified two types of inflammatory response in the peri-implant tissue. One is plaque associated inflammatory cell infiltrate which was associated with the gingival sulcus, the second was abutment associated inflammatory infiltrate which was associated with the implant–abutment junction. This indicated that, like the natural tooth once the biological seal is established to the implant, it provides a protective function to isolate the crestal bone from the oral environment.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Berglundh and Lindhe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] in their study reported that in the absence of a minimum soft tissue thickness of 3 mm, the body attempts to re-establish this dimension. The loss of crestal bone height is thus suggested to be a biologic response to create space for circum-implant fiber orientation to the implant surface thus depicting that the orientation of the fibers are very important in maintaining plaque control thus reducing the crestal bone loss.</p>
              <p id="Par43">In concordance to the studies by Ericcson et al. and Berglundh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], site-specific plaque and bleeding scores taken at 1 year and 3 years post-early loading, revealed a highly statistically significant reduction in the test group (&lt; 0.001 and &lt; 0.001, respectively), which could be correlated to the reduction in the inflammatory infiltrate due to the soft tissue seal formed at the laser-microgrooved surface of the laser-microgrooved abutments.</p>
              <p id="Par44">The peri-implant sulcus depth taken at baseline, 1 year and 3 years post-early loading, showed a statistically significant difference between the control and test group, at both 1 and 3 years post-early loading compared to the baseline (&lt; 0.011, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.401, respectively). In the test group there was relatively less peri-implant sulcus depth than the control at both 1 and 3 years post-early loading, which could be extrapolated to the study by Nevins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] who did a proof of principle study with laser-microgrooved implants (Biohorizon) which revealed that the laser-microgrooves were fully covered with functionally oriented collagen fibers which prevented the apical migration of epithelium, in contrast to the machined abutment surface where the oriented collagen fibers did not extend to or attach to the metal surface. Nevins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] in a canine model study revealed that the healing pattern around micro-grooved abutments demonstrated connective tissue fiber attachment oriented perpendicular to the laser-microgrooved abutments thus validating the reduction of peri-implant sulcus depth in the test group in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Propelling onto the other objective of the current study which was to evaluate the role of micro-grooved implants–abutments to prevent crestal bone loss, the mean crestal bone loss was estimated to be 1.08 and 0.76 mm in the Test group at 1 year post-early loading, which was statistically significant with a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; 0.04. At 3 years of post-early loading, the crestal bone loss varied from 1.08 to 1.93 mm in the control group and 0.76 mm to 0.61 mm in the test group which was statistically significant with a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; 0.001.</p>
              <p id="Par46">The difference in the crestal bone loss from 1 to 3 years of post-early loading in the control group was 0.85 mm, whereas there was “bone gain” of 0.15 mm in the test group. This observation points out to the fact that the crestal bone dimensions varied considerably at 1 year and 3 years of post-early loading, indicating that a combination of laser-microgrooved implants–abutments indicated the ability to prevent crestal bone loss which could be in line with a recent study by Barros et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] which demonstrated that laser-microgrooved abutments positively and significantly affect establishment of soft tissues with functionally oriented collagen fibers due to better levels of bone height obtained around immediate placed and loaded implants.</p>
              <p id="Par47">The greater crestal bone loss observed in the control group could be attributed to the fact that the machined abutments did not have gingival fibers oriented perpendicular to the abutment. In another study reported recently, it is understood that an inadequate epithelial attachment to the machined trans-mucosal segment could have probably caused a micro gap to be inoculated by bacteria from the peri-implant sulcus resulting in an increase in the plaque induced inflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] thus leading to greater crestal bone loss when compared to the test group. This could be correlated to the study by Nevins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] which stated that the oriented gingival fibers that had developed in the laser-microgrooves of the healing abutment reattached to the micro-grooves on the definitive abutments, which presented no crestal bone loss compared to that of machined abutments.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Laser-microgrooved implants (Laser-lok implants 3.8 mm × 10.5 mm, 3.3 mm × 12 mm, 4.6 mm × 10.5 mm and 4.6mmX12mm) used in our study were procured from Biohorizon which were tapered internal hex laser-lok implants which has a 2-mm micromachined collar containing microchannels for enabling connective tissue and bone attachment. Platform switching with laser-microgrooved prosthetic abutments were also procured from Biohorizon contains laser-lok microchannels on the collar (1 mm collar, 3 mm collar) with 3.5-mm and 4.5-mm platforms.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Thus based on the previous published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the results obtained from our study, we could hypothesize that laser-microgrooved implants and abutments could have probably secured a functional orientation of collagen fibers which prevented the apical migration of the epithelium, thus validating the reduced peri-implant sulcus depth and the reduced crestal bone loss in the test group.</p>

              <title>Summary and conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par50">The present study addresses the issue of mean crestal bone loss as a potential threat for peri-implantitis besides overcoming the same through technical modifications on the implant surface like laser-micro grooving of Implants. Within the limitations of the study, the following facts could be established, (1) The significant reduction in the Peri-implant Sulcus Depth in the Test group with a <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.001 at 3 years post-early loading could be hypothesized based on the previous histological studies done by Nevins et al. 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] of the perpendicular orientation of fibers at the trans-mucosal segment of the laser-microgrooved abutments. (2) The significant reduction in the mean crestal bone loss in the test group with a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; 0.001 at 3 years post-early loading.</p>
              <p id="Par51">The study further emphasizes that laser-microgrooved implants, along with laser-microgrooved abutments, could be a two pronged strategy to prevent mean crestal bone loss thus promoting a healthy implant abutment junction which is free of inflammatory infiltrates, which requires further longitudinal studies for establishing the same with more clinical parameters.</p>
