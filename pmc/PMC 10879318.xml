                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Chronic periodontitis patients (stage III and IV, grade B and C) with 4 interproximal residual pockets were randomly assigned to the test (HyA gel) or control (saline) group. After subgingival instrumentation, test or control substance was applied subgingivally, then daily supragingivally for 3 months, and if required a second time after subgingival re-instrumentation after 3 months. Clinical and patient reported outcome parameters were recorded every 3 months for 12 months. Pocket closure [probing pocket depth (PPD) ≤ 4mm with absence of bleeding on probing (BoP) at PPD = 4mm] was the main outcome parameter.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Fifty-six patients (221 experimental sites) were analysed. Pocket closure was achieved in 56.8 and 46.6% of the experimental sites in the test and control group, respectively (p &gt; 0.05), while median PPD and PPD distribution (&lt; 5mm/5mm/ &gt; 5mm) differed significantly between groups in favour of the test group, at 12 months. Further, significantly fewer sites in the HyA group required re-instrumentation at 3 months, and sites in the HyA group showed a tendency for lower odds to remain diseased compared to the control group (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.22–1.06). The odds for a site to remain diseased after 12 months increased significantly in the presence of plaque (OR 7.94, 95%CI 4.12–15.28), but in general, decreased significantly over time (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.28–0.81).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Re-instrumentation of residual pockets in SPC patients, per se<italic>,</italic> leads to a significant increase in pocket closure over time; this was impeded by poor plaque control. Repeated local application of HyA results in fewer sites requiring re-instrumentation and might slightly improve the rate of pocket closure. (clinicaltrials.gov registration nr. NCT04792541).</p>

                  <title>Clinical relevance</title>
                  <p id="Par5">HyA gel is easy to apply, well accepted by patients, and may have some positive effect in terms of fewer sites requiring re-instrumentation at 3 months and higher pocket closure rate at 12 months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">Initial non-surgical subgingival instrumentation (i.e., second step of therapy), either by hand or (ultra)sonic instruments (or a combination thereof), is a very successful treatment approach in periodontitis patients; on average, a shallow probing pocket depth (PPD) can be achieved in 3 out of 4 pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, the World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri‐Implant Diseases and Conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the EFP S3 level Clinical Practice Guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] have defined the goal of periodontal treatment. On the site level, pocket closure is defined as PPD ≤ 4 mm and no bleeding on probing (BoP), while on the patient level, a successfully treated stable periodontitis patient is characterized by having 1) PPD of ≤ 4 mm, 2) no PPD = 4 mm with BoP, and 3) full-mouth BoP &lt; 10%. Although this goal is difficult to achieve in every patient, it has been shown that patients reaching these clinical endpoints present a reduced rate of disease progression/recurrence and tooth loss due to periodontitis during long-term supportive periodontal care (SPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Hence, the use of adjunct products (locally or systemically delivered) during the second step of therapy is frequently discussed, with the aim to 1) further improve the rate of pocket closure, 2) reduce the need for additional surgical therapy, and/or 3) improve the rate of achieving a successfully treated stable periodontitis patient. This in turn, should not only improve long-term stability of treatment and reduce tooth loss, but also minimize patient morbidity and eventually treatment costs. The various options and the efficacy of locally delivered adjuncts (i.e., host modulators or antimicrobials) during the second step of therapy have been evaluated extensively within the frames of the EFP S3 level Clinical Practice Guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It was finally suggested that only locally applied sustained-released chlorhexidine and antibiotics may be considered as valid options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this context, there is limited information about the “best” timepoint of delivery of locally applied adjuncts, in terms of (cost-)efficiency, i.e., whether they should be applied during the second step of therapy or during the third or fourth step of therapy at re-instrumentation of residual/relapsing pockets, respectively. Considering patient, societal, and/or possible biological impacts of unnecessary use of any adjunct measure, the latter approach would allow to limit their use to those patients/sites, which do not heal after the initial subgingival instrumentation. Two recent systematic reviews covered the efficacy of adjuncts for periodontitis patients with residual/relapsing pockets during SPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Specifically, among locally delivered antimicrobials, sustained-release chlorhexidine and tetracycline fibres, ranked highest with a statistically and clinically significant additional PPD reduction of approximately 0.6 to 0.7 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], while insufficient evidence is available for any other adjunctive treatment option (i.e., other than antimicrobials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Another locally delivered adjunct, however, which has neither been included in any of the above-mentioned systematic reviews nor in the EFP S3 level Clinical Practice Guideline, is hyaluronic acid (HyA). Various gels containing HyA in different concentrations have been, since several years, tested as adjuncts to non-surgical mechanical subgingival instrumentation and their efficacy has even been summarized in few systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These reviews had well-comparable conclusions, i.e., most of the included clinical trials reported a positive, albeit moderate, effect in favour of HyA in terms of PPD and BoP reduction. However, there was a large variation in application modes and -frequency in the original studies, and all reviews stressed the need for further well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), including sufficient reporting of product details. In this context, it is currently not clear whether repeated application of a locally delivered adjunct is, in general, advantageous compared to single application, i.e., only just after instrumentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, 2 recent RCTs have assessed in-office HyA application specifically in re-instrumentation of residual/relapsing pockets. Each study tested a different HyA product and application frequency; in one of the studies HyA was applied subgingivally, once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while in the other study HyA was applied subgingivally at 2 consecutive appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but both showed a tendency in favour of HyA application.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Thus, it seems reasonable to assess whether combined local application of HyA, i.e., subgingivally in-office, after mechanical instrumentation, and repeated supragingivally, by the patient, once per day for 3 months, has the potential to improve the rate of pocket closure compared to re-instrumentation alone in the treatment of residual pockets in periodontitis patients undergoing regular SPC.</p>

                <p id="Par12">Prior to the beginning of the study a random sequence list for group allocation was computer generated (ratio 1:1 for the test/HyA and control/placebo group) by a periodontist not included in the recruitment process (KB). All participants were recruited by one of 3 experienced dental hygienists (LG, AS, MSS). Four interproximal sites of each participant were defined as experimental sites (i.e., mesio-buccal, mesio-palatal/-lingual, disto-buccal, or disto-palatal/-lingual); if possible 1 site per quadrant was chosen, otherwise the experimental sites had to be in different interproximal spaces. All participants received at baseline a standard SPC session including re-instrumentation with an ultrasonic device (E.M.S. Electro Medical Systems S.A., Nyon, Switzerland) and/or hand instruments (HuFriedyGroup, Chicago, USA) of all residual pockets by one of the above-mentioned 3 dental hygienists; each patient was treated by the same dental hygienist throughout the study period. Group allocation was concealed until after re-instrumentation of the residual pockets. After re-instrumentation, a periodontist (AZ) joined the treatment session, revealed group allocation only to himself by opening a hidden note in the envelope with the patient’s case report form, and applied either the test or placebo product subgingivally at all experimental sites. For subgingival application the test and placebo product were transferred into a sterile syringe with a blunt needle and the experimental sites were filled until the product was overflowing from the pocket (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The same periodontist performed this procedure to all participants, while the dental hygienists and patients remained blinded to group allocation. Each patient received a leaflet with a summary of the relevant instructions and a drawing indicating the 4 experimental sites including the correct size of interdental brushes (TePe Munhygienprodukter AB, Malmö, Sweden) for the specific interproximal space and either the test or placebo product. Patients had to apply the product once daily supragingivally with an interdental brush after tooth-brushing, only at the experimental sites, and for the coming 3 months until the second SPC appointment (i.e., 3-month follow-up). In addition, the patients were instructed to avoid tooth brushing or eating for 3 h after the application and not to use any mouth rinsing solutions or any other gels during participating in the present study. SPC sessions were repeated after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, however, the patient stopped applying the test or placebo product after the first 3 months. Finally, all experimental sites with PPD = 5 mm and BoP or PPD &gt; 5 mm at the 3-month follow-up received again re-instrumentation and a second subgingival application of the allocated product, as described above. In general, all sites with PPD = 5 mm and BoP or PPD &gt; 5 mm at any of the SPC sessions received as a standard of care subgingival re-instrumentation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The experimental sites (<bold>a</bold>) received at the first supportive periodontal care session standard re-instrumentation with an ultrasonic device (<bold>b</bold>) and/or hand instruments (<bold>c</bold>) and after debridement the test or placebo product was applied subgingivally (in this specific case, the test product) (<bold>d</bold>–<bold>e</bold>); the patient returned for follow-ups after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (<bold>f</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="784_2024_5505_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par13">Subgingival microbiological sampling from the 4 experimental sites was performed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The results of the microbiological sampling will be reported elsewhere. Further, after the microbiological sampling and at each SPC (i.e., at baseline, and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) the same blinded and calibrated dental hygienist (LG, AS, MSS) recorded PPD, clinical attachment level (CAL), presence/absence of BoP, and presence/absence of plaque at each experimental site. As a standard of care the periodontist (AZ) of this specific Specialist Clinic controls the PPD measurements of each hygienist approximately 2- to 3-times per year, which was considered as calibration. Further, at each follow-up patients were asked about any changes in their medical history, and about any intake of antibiotics in the preceding 3 months. At the second SPC (i.e., 3-month follow-up), the patients additionally received a short questionnaire about their opinion of the tested product. The questionnaire asked for the presence and intensity of pain during application, and for the patients’ opinion on the consistency and taste of the product during home use, using a scale from 1 to 10. A successful treatment outcome (i.e., pocket closure) was defined as PPD ≤ 4 mm with absence of BoP at PPD = 4 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; if these criteria were not fulfilled the experimental site remained classified as “diseased”.

Further, the total period from the first to the fifth SPC appointment was not allowed to exceed 18 months, otherwise the patient was excluded. Due to having included several patients prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, patients were allowed to miss either the 6- or 9-month appointment without being excluded from the study. However, patients missing 2 SPC sessions or the 3- or 12-month appointment were also excluded.</p>

                <p id="Par15">For the sample size calculation, it was assumed, that 75 and 25% of the sites in the test/HyA and control/placebo group, respectively, would achieve pocket closure, i.e., PPD ≤ 4 mm with absence of BoP at PPD = 4 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the presence of these clinical parameters risk for disease progression is considered as low and treatment is considered as successful. Based on the data set of a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] an intra-individual correlation coefficient of 0.42 is assumed for the presence of BoP. Based on this correlation coefficient, a power of 0.80, and an alpha value of 0.05, a sample size of 30 participants per group (i.e., total study population of 60) was calculated. To compensate for dropouts a total of 80 patients (40 patients per group) were consecutively recruited.</p>

To test for any differences between the test/HyA and control/placebo group either Fisher’s exact test or chi-squared test was applied for categorical parameters (i.e., chi-squared test was applied if each cell presented with a frequency &gt; 5) and for continuous variables either an independent <italic>t</italic>-test (for normally distributed data) or a Mann Whitney-U test (for non-normally distributed data). Normality of the data was controlled by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The “health status of the experimental site” was defined as the primary outcome parameter [dichotomous; “diseased” (i.e., PPD &gt; 4 mm or PPD = 4 mm with BoP) versus “successfully treated/pocket closure” (i.e., PPD ≤ 4 mm with absence of BoP at PPD = 4 mm). Two multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models were calculated with the group allocation as the main predictor and the following a priori confounders: 1) tooth type (anterior / premolar / molar), 2) interproximal site (buccal / palatal/lingual), 3) PPD at baseline at the experimental site (5 mm / 6–7 mm), 4) plaque at the experimental site at each appointment (absent / present), 5) smoking status (never / former / current), 6) gender (female / male), 7) time passed between appointments (months), and 8) age (years). The first model included only the 3-month data, while the second model included all data collected over a 12-month period; in the latter model an additional confounder was added, i.e., timepoint (3- / 6- / 9- / 12-month follow-up). Statistical analysis was performed with STATA/IC 17.0 for Mac (Lakeway Drive, Texas, USA) and a p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par25">Locally delivered chemotherapeutics are frequently used as adjunct to non-surgical treatment in periodontitis patients, either at the initial phase of treatment or at residual/relapsing pockets during a later stage of treatment. However, as initial non-surgical subgingival instrumentation is a rather successful treatment per se, a more site-specific approach for pockets that did not heal during the second step of therapy, and/or of relapsing pockets during SPC might be the more relevant approach. Herein, a HyA containing gel, repeatedly applied (daily) for a period of 3 months, as adjunct to re-instrumentation of residual/relapsing pockets in patients undergoing regular SPC, showed some tendency to improve the outcome, i.e., 10% higher rate of pocket closure was observed for the sites receiving HyA compared to those in the control group that received physiological saline solution (i.e., 57 versus 47% of the sites, respectively), after 12 months. Additionally, the percentage of experimental sites with PPD &lt; 5 mm was about 1.4-times higher in the test/HyA group compared to the control/placebo group (i.e., 71 and 52% of the sites, respectively).</p>
              <p id="Par26">These results are in agreement with those reported in 2 recent RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] assessing a HyA containing gel as adjunct to re-instrumentation of residual/relapsing pockets and showing that the use of a HyA containing gel resulted in a tendency for superior results compared to re-instrumentation only. Moreover, both studies reported in their test group a similar frequency of sites with PPD &lt; 5 mm after 12 months as herein, i.e., 76 to 77% in the 2 previous studies and 71% herein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Further, in one of the RCT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reporting on pocket closure (i.e., PPD ≤ 4 mm without BoP), a comparable rate in the HyA group as herein was observed, i.e., in 59 and 57%, respectively. A significant difference, however, between those 2 RCTs and the current study regard the product characteristics of the applied HyA gel. Specifically, a non-crosslinked, middle molecular weight HyA with a relatively low concentration (0.3%) was used in this study, while the other studies either used a product with crosslinked, high-molecular HyA at a higher concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or a combination product with polynucleotides and high-molecular HyA at a higher concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Laboratory studies on periodontal cells or periodontitis-associated pathogens have compared the effects of either non-crosslinked and crosslinked HyA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or of HyA of different molecular weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; none of the formulations tested showed any negative effect in terms of periodontal wound healing. In this context, due to the lack of comparative clinical trials up-to-now, it remains unclear whether different HyA characteristics indeed translate into clinically relevant differences. Another difference among those 2 RCTs and herein regard the application mode/frequency of HyA. In this study, the HyA containing gel was repeatedly (daily) applied supragingivally for 3 months by the patients in addition to the subgingival in-office applications. One of the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] assessed the effect of a repeated in-office application after 3 months but failed to show any additional beneficial effect of HyA after the re-application; however, prior to re-application no additional subgingival instrumentation was performed in this specific study. Herein, only sites with remaining signs of pathology received a re-application in combination with subgingival re-instrumentation. In both groups (i.e., test and control) approximately 30% of the sites requiring re-instrumentation and re-application were judged as successfully treated at the end of the trial. Nevertheless, although re-treatment improved the situation in 1 out of 3 cases and no distinct beneficial effect of HyA could be noted, the number of sites requiring re-instrumentation (re-treatment) at 3 months, was significantly lower in the HyA group, comparing with the one receiving NaCl. Finally, also the current data do not allow any conclusion on any potential additional effect of repeated supragingival application by the patients for 3 months, as a third group with subgingival in-office delivery only was lacking herein.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In general, reducing the number of residual pockets after active periodontal treatment (i.e., step 1 to 3) has been shown beneficial in terms of disease recurrence/progression and tooth loss in various studies focusing on long-term SPC after active periodontal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that any treatment measure, such as the use of locally applied adjuncts, that improve the rate of pocket closure – irrespective the stage of treatment – may contribute positively also to the long-term outcome. In this context, HyA containing gels as adjunct to subgingival instrumentation in the second step of therapy have shown some potential in terms of PPD and BoP reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which has been re-confirmed by more recent RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">Compared to other studies with a similar study design but assessing different products as adjuncts to re-instrumentation of residual pockets in SPC patients, the frequency of pocket closure appeared a bit lower herein. For example, 2 recent RCTs assessing the adjunctive effect of flapless application of enamel matrix derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], sodium hypochlorite gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and chlorhexidine gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported pocket closure (i.e., PPD ≤ 4 mm without BoP) in 80, 78, and 63% of the sites compared to 57% herein. Hence, and considering the lack of RCTs directly comparing these products, HyA appeared similarly effective to CHX gel, but slightly inferior to enamel matrix derivatives and sodium hypochlorite gel. The latter might be of specific interest, as the combination of sodium hypochlorite gel with crosslinked HyA gel has recently received attention as combined adjunctive treatment in periodontitis patients. However, a recent retrospective case series including 29 SPC patients with residual/relapsing pockets reported for this combined approach a somewhat lower pocket closure rate of 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">Among the confounders used for adjusting of the present analysis, two had a significant effect on the outcome at final evaluation, i.e., plaque control and compliance/time, which are both well in agreement with the literature. Specifically, herein the presence of plaque, which was assessed at each experimental site at each SPC session, significantly lowered the odds of achieving pocket closure. To successfully motivate patients for continuous high levels of plaque control during SPC is a well-known clinical challenge and recent long-term SPC studies re-confirmed the clinical relevance of it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Both studies, including 100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and &gt; 200 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], respectively, undergoing approximately 10 years of SPC after active periodontal treatment, showed an increased risk for disease recurrence and tooth loss due to periodontitis with poor plaque control. Further, the patients of the present RCT showed in general and independent of group allocation a significant improvement over time, which became significant after 12 months. Specifically, also in the control/placebo group almost 50% of the experimental sites achieved pocket closure at the end of the trial. This effect size of achieving pocket closure by mechanical re-instrumentation only is well comparable with previous studies reporting rates of 42 to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, study participation per se probably has a beneficial effect on the compliance from a patient perspective but also from the perspective of the treating dentist/dental hygienist, who might be more insisting on keeping the 3-month interval. In this context, it has been shown, that a shorter time between consecutive SPC sessions can result over time in reduced PPD and periodontal stability, while a longer time may lead to periodontal instability and subsequently tooth loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">The present study – performed under “real-life” conditions – comes with some limitations, such as a relatively high drop-out rate of 30%, which did not permit us reaching the intended sample size in the control/placebo group, i.e., 26 instead of 30 participants were analyzed. The high drop-out rate is at least partly owed to participants missing their scheduled appointments during the Covid-19 pandemic, i.e., although a range of 2.5 to 5 months between 2 SPC sessions was accepted, almost 10% of the participants (i.e., 2 and 5 of the test/HyA and control/placebo group, respectively) were excluded from the analysis due to too long intervals. Nevertheless, as the time between 2 SPC sessions appears as a relevant factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], this parameter was included in the regression analyses herein, to correct in the model the slight variation in SPC intervals. However, as the present trial was performed in parallel-group design, the patients did not receive both products, which in turn should limit any bias due to insufficient patient blinding. In this context it was interesting, that the groups presented no significant difference regarding patient opinion about the consistency and taste of the product; both products were well accepted by the patients, which in turn may indicate good compliance.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par31">Re-instrumentation of residual pockets in SPC patients, per se<italic>,</italic> leads to a significant increase in pocket closure over time. This improvement was dependent of the patient’s oral hygiene, i.e., the presence of plaque increased the odds to remain diseased by approximately 8-times. The additional sub- and supragingival repeated application of a HyA containing gel resulted in significantly fewer sites requiring re-instrumentation at 3 months, and into some clinically relevant differences after 12 months of SPC compared to the control/placebo group, such as 71 versus 52% of experimental sites reaching a PPD &lt; 5 mm, respectively. However, statistical significance of this effect was marginally missed in the adjusted analysis on achieving pocket closure. Hence, further clinical trials are needed to confirm superiority of this adjunct compared to subgingival re-instrumentation alone.</p>
