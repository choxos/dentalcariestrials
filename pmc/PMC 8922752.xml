                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The design is a stratified-randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial with nine treatment arms. The trial will involve recruiting at least 414 3- to 5-year-old kindergarten children with caries, who will receive approximately 0.004 mL of 38% SDF (the typical amount applied per the manufacturer’s instructions) to treat each caries lesion. The children will be stratified by caries status, randomised by blocks, and allocated to nine groups of SDF application times: 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 s. The outcome measure is caries lesion activity (active/arrest) at the tooth-surface level at 6 months post-initial treatment. A calibrated dentist will conduct the blinded clinical examinations at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up. In addition, the parents will be surveyed to examine the effects of the moderating variables, such as oral hygiene, on caries lesion activity. The hypothesis is that a monotonically increasing trend can be found between the SDF application time and the proportion of caries lesions that are arrested. The Cochran-Armitage test for trends in proportions, corrected for clustering within children, will be used to determine the relationship between the exposure to SDF (the SDF application time) and the response (proportion of lesions arrested) in children, taking into consideration the effect of the moderating variables as well as the nesting of multiple caries lesions within an individual child. An EC 80 analysis (an 80% maximal concentration) will be used to determine the exposure (the SDF application time) for 80% caries lesion arrest. Bootstrap methods will be used for clustered data and will be resampled by clustering to determine the 95% confidence interval.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study will help with determining the optimal application time for SDF treatment. It will provide an evidence-based protocol for the use of SDF to arrest tooth decay in the primary teeth of young children. The results will inform an evidence-based SDF protocol to arrest caries, which affects 573 million children with tooth decay worldwide.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Early childhood caries (ECC), which causes pain and infection, remains a challenging problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Untreated caries will progress into the tooth pulp to eventually form a dental abscess [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, premature tooth loss due to ECC affects oral function and dentition. Poor dentition significantly affects children’s nutrition and consequently their growth, development, and general health. ECC is particularly prevalent among socially disadvantaged children, such as those from poor families and those whose parents have low educational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, prevailing restorative methods for preventing and treating ECC are neither available nor affordable for these children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Clinical studies have demonstrated that using 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) prevents and arrests ECC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] A literature review of SDF suggested that 38% SDF can be an effective agent in preventing new caries as well as arresting dental caries in the primary teeth of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another review also concluded that SDF is an effective, efficient, and equitable caries-control agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Milgrom and Chi (2011) advocated for SDF therapy as an important prevention-centred caries management strategy during critical early childhood periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Clinicians typically apply 38% SDF solution topically to a dental caries lesion and then leave it on the tooth for a certain amount of time before washing away any excess. Studies have used arbitrary application times with no consensus. However, clinicians have recommended a range of increasing application times with no scientific evidence (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A short application time is desirable because SDF is frequently applied to very young children who have difficulty with cooperating. Often caries can affect multiple teeth, which makes SDF application even more difficult, especially in younger children. A lack of cooperation often compromises treatment or renders SDF treatment impossible or ineffective. A search found no published or registered trials on the SDF exposure time-response relationship. Thus, this study addresses an important gap in the knowledge regarding SDF treatment.

                <p id="Par15">The trained dentist will perform clinical examinations of the participating children in the kindergartens. The dentist will carry out a careful visual inspection with the aid of a World Health Organization (WHO) Community Periodontal Index (CPI) periodontal probe and a front-surface dental mirror with light-emitting diode intra-oral illumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The oral hygiene status will be measured using the visible plaque index (VPI). Both the buccal and the lingual surfaces of six index teeth (55, 51, 63, 71, 75, and 83) will be examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The presence or absence of visible plaque on the caries surface will also be recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Tooth status (decayed, missing, filled surface [dmfs] score), tooth discolouration, and hyper-mobility will be recorded in the chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Teeth with carious lesions extending into the pulps, or signs suggesting that the teeth are non-vital, such as tooth discolouration, hypermobility, or abscesses, will not be included in this study. Dental caries will be diagnosed at the cavitation level. The carious lesion will be gently explored using a WHO CPI probe in the centre of the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Great care will be taken to avoid tooth damage during the probing. A carious lesion will be recorded as active if softness is detected, whereas if the dentine surface is hard to probe, it will be classified as an arrested caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. All surfaces (i.e., buccal, lingual, mesial, distal, and occlusal for the posterior teeth) of each tooth will be assessed. In addition, the colour of the carious lesion will be classified into one of four categories according to PANTONE colour plates (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) placed next to the carious lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The primary endpoint or outcome measure is active carious lesion at baseline that becomes arrested in the 6-month follow-up. The same dentist will serve as the examiner throughout the 6-month follow-up. Intra-examiner agreement on the plaque and caries assessment will be monitored and conducted in 10% of the children at each stage of the clinical trial.

We assume that a monotonically increasing trend exists and that the caries arrest rate is 80% for a 180 s application. Therefore, the expected caries arrest rates are 65.25%, 65.42%, 65.83%, 66.25%, 67.50%, 68.75%, 70.00%, 75.00%, and 80.00% for 3-s, 5-s, 10-s, 15-s, 30-s, 45-s, 60-s, 120-s, and 180-s applications, respectively. The power will be set at 90%, and the one-sided type I error (α) will be set at 0.025 (equivalent to a two-sided type I error of α = 0.05). The required sample size for detecting proportion trends is 104 surfaces of carious lesions per group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study, the mean number of surfaces of carious lesions at baseline per child is estimated to be 4.75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, the anticipated intraclass correlation coefficient is 0.23. This clinical trial requires 195 surfaces of carious lesions from 41 children per group following the equation for a multi-level study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The protocol details the procedures for data entry, management, cleaning, and analysis. Two research assistants will enter the collected data into an Excel file, and they will compare the entered data to minimise data entry errors. The research assistants will also assess the intra-examiner agreement regarding caries diagnoses and the VPI at each time point using Cohen’s kappa statistics. The level of statistical significance for all two-sided tests will be set at 0.05.</p>
                <p id="Par40">We will perform the Cochran-Armitage test for trends in proportions with correction for clustering. In addition, we will explore the trend in the arrest rates of carious lesions with increasing SDF exposure (application) times, taking into consideration the effect of the moderating variables and the number of surfaces of the carious lesions. The power calculations will be based on a steady linear increase, and the power of the study will be less if a plateau is reached before 180 s. Thus, we will set the power at 90% in our sample size calculation and estimate the profile non-parametrically to see if any plateau is reached at a given time. EC80 (an 80% maximal concentration) analysis will be used to determine the exposure (the SDF application time) at which 80% of the carious lesions are arrested. Because individual children may have more than one lesion, we will use bootstrap methods for clustered data, and resample by cluster to determine the 95% confidence interval. An in-house statistician will perform statistical analyses using the software of IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 26 (IBM Corp.

We will perform a sensitivity analysis (attributable estimand) to address the outcomes for those children not completing the 6-month study. We will assume that none of the treated teeth will be arrested among dropouts and thus will include dropouts in the sensitivity analysis. However, our experience from previous trials suggests that the number of children who will drop out in 6 months will likely be less than 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

It is well accepted among both children and clinicians for caries management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, it has great potential to aid the dental public health community in addressing dental caries in at-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A review reported that SDF can arrest caries when it is applied to caries for 10 s to 180 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The manufacturer recommends a 30-s to 60-s application time. Most clinical guidelines recommend that SDF should be applied and retained on the teeth for 60 s to 180 s. However, scientific evidence supporting the recommendations is lacking. The optimal SDF application time in clinical practice remains unknown and thus requires further validation. Thus, this study will help with determining the optimal application time in SDF treatment. It will provide an evidence-based protocol for the use of SDF to arrest ECC. The results will inform an evidence-based SDF protocol for arresting the caries of many young children with tooth decay worldwide.</p>
              <p id="Par45">This trial will use the kappa statistic because it is a simple and frequently used statistical method for testing intra-examiner reliability. The intra-examiner reliability is important because it represents the extent to which the variables are appropriately rated in the trial. Cohen kappa is the corresponding reliability coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A limitation of the kappa statistic is that it is sensitive to the true prevalence of the variable measured. A high (or low) true prevalence will increase the expected agreement by chance. The Cochran-Armitage trend test will be used in this trial whether or not a linear trend is found when the response is binary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This statistical method can be used to analyse ordinal data. The SDF application time can be ordered from 3 s to 180 s, and we expect that the caries arrest rate will increase when the SDF application time increases. The power of the study will be less if a plateau is reached before 180 s. Therefore, we set the power at 90% in our sample size calculation.</p>
              <p id="Par46">This trial will use EC<sub>80</sub> (80% maximal concentration) analysis. EC<sub>80</sub> can be defined as the exposure (the SDF application time) required to obtain 80% of caries arrest. We will use the bootstrap method for clustered data, and perform resample by cluster to determine the 95% confidence interval. The bootstrap method uses simulation to calculate standard errors, confidence intervals, and significance tests, and it does not rely on many assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It resamples (with replacement) the sample data and creates a large number of phantom samples known as bootstrap samples. A major advantage of using the bootstrap method is its simplicity. It is a straightforward way of deriving estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals for complex estimators of the distribution. However, this method relies on a representative sample and can be time-consuming. This clinical trial will also employ an intention-to-treat analysis to address dropouts. Intention-to-treat analysis is a method for analysing the results of all children according to the groups to which they are assigned, regardless of what application times they received. This method generates an unbiased conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
