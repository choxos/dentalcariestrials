                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients were randomized to CAD/CAM or conventional FRs in both arches, in a 1:1 ratio and blocks of four. Allocation concealment was secured by using sequentially numbered envelopes. Patients were blinded. FRs were bonded at the end of treatment, and patients were recalled after 12 and 24 months. First-time retainer failures were recorded and digital impressions were taken. Arch widths and lengths, as well as Little’s Irregularity Index (LII), were measured. Additionally, patients answered satisfaction questionnaires. Linear mixed models were applied for measurements and patient satisfaction. Survival analyses were estimated with Kaplan–Meier curves, along with Cox-regression modelling. Cost-minimization analysis was undertaken.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>One hundred and eighty-one patients were randomized (98 in Centre 1, and 83 in Centre 2): 90 in CAD/CAM and 91 in conventional group. One hundred and fifty three patients attended T24 follow-up. There were no significant differences in LII and arch dimensions between groups for failure-free patients. Within 24 months, 34% maxillary CAD/CAM FRs and 38% maxillary conventional FRs failed, along with 42% mandibular CAD/CAM FRs and 40% mandibular conventional FRs, with no significant difference in survival between groups (hazard ratios conventional to CAD/CAM: maxillary arch: 1.20 [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.46], mandibular arch: 0.98 [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.94]). There were no significant differences in patient satisfaction between groups. No harms were observed. Cost-minimization analysis showed that CAD/CAM FRs were slightly cheaper than conventional FRs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Maintaining a stable result after orthodontic treatment remains one of the biggest challenges in orthodontics. Tooth position may change after treatment due to periodontal, gingival, and occlusal factors as well as normal growth and dentofacial ageing, with unpredictable and variable magnitude of movement [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To maintain the achieved clinical outcome, on completion of orthodontic treatment, most of the patients are provided with some type of retainer to resist post-treatment tooth position change.</p>
              <p>There is insufficient high-quality evidence to distinctly demonstrate which is the best type of orthodontic retention regime [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are primarily two options for orthodontic retention, either removable retainers or fixed retainers (FRs). Randomized controlled trials comparing FRs and removable retainers have not conclusively proved one type of retention protocol to be superior to the other [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref>]. Previously, it has been shown that over time patient adherence with removable retainers significantly drops [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], thereby resulting in potentially worse long-term retention compared to FRs. Patients seem to prefer FRs because they require less compliance [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and are more comfortable to wear compared to removable retainers [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Since the benefits of long-term orthodontic retention have been identified [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there has been an increased use of FRs [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, it is important to acknowledge that the use of FRs is frequently associated with diverse complications, such as bond failure and wire fracture, potential for adverse effects on dental and periodontal health, unwanted tooth movement with the FR <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>, and adverse effects on general health [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is unclear which is the best type of FR to minimize the occurrence of various complications, while also offering reliable retention and being cost-effective and comfortable to wear to the patients [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>In recent years, FRs employing computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology have emerged as potential alternatives to conventional handcrafted retainers. These CAD/CAM FRs have been considered advantageous because they might offer better clinical effectiveness due to their precision fit, potential for avoidance of occlusal interferences, and possibly improved passive fitting [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several studies have evaluated the clinical effectiveness of CAD/CAM FRs, however, only in the mandibular arch and mainly in short term [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref>]. Thus, it remains unclear whether CAD/CAM FRs might present better longer-term clinical effectiveness than conventional handcrafted retainers when used in both arches.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing stability, failure rate, patient satisfaction, and cost-minimization of CAD/CAM nitinol FRs versus multistranded (MS) stainless steel FRs in both arches. Further, it is also one of the largest RCTs about FRs in general. The present article presents results from an ongoing RCT over a 24-month follow-up period.</p>

                <title>Objectives and hypotheses</title>
                <p>The aims of this RCT were to assess and compare the clinical effectiveness of CAD/CAM versus conventional MS FRs in terms of post-treatment stability (primary outcome), failure rate, patient satisfaction, and cost-minimization (secondary outcomes) during a 2-year period. The null hypothesis was that CAD/CAM FRs exhibit no significant differences compared to MS FRs in terms of stability, failure rate, patient satisfaction, and cost-minimization.</p>

All analyses were conducted utilizing Stata Statistical Software (Release 16. College Station, StataCorp, TX, USA). For arch dimensions and LII, each individual measurement was modelled by a linear mixed model with an unstructured marginal covariance pattern to induce a correlation between repeated measures on the same patient [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The survival analyses were done by the Kaplan–Meier curves separately for the maxillary and mandibular FRs, along with a Cox-regression modelling with the Breslow method for ties to assess predictors for FR survival. VAS results were adjusted for age, gender, randomization group, and time, in addition to modelling by a linear mixed regression model, but with repeated measures on the same patient. All linear mixed models included a Kenward–Roger adjustment for the denominator degrees of freedom. To maintain the study-wise significance level at 5%, a one-step Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment was employed for modelling multiple individual outcomes. For example, when modelling the 5 questions in the VAS questionnaire, the individual significance level for each VAS outcome was revised down to 1%.</p>

                <p>The cost-minimization analysis was performed using direct costs only, given that indirect costs, defined previously as loss of school or working hours [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], were the same for both FR groups. The direct costs included material costs, chair time costs, and salary for the orthodontists. The cost analysis was performed only for Norway as it is expected to be similar to Denmark. One CAD/CAM FR costs 111 Euro (€), and one conventional MS FR costs 126 €, both prices including shipping. The cost of chair time (premises, dental equipment, maintenance, cleaning) was calculated as 125 € per hour (hr), based on a previous study published in 2013 (23) and taking into account an inflation rate of 28% from 2013 to 2023 (source: worlddata.info). The average annual salary for a Norwegian orthodontist working for the public dental health services was estimated as 113 000 € (source: dental health service’s competence centres). The time for FR bonding was considered similar for both groups and was estimated as 6.7 minutes (min) per FR based on a previous study using a similar FR bonding technique with a transfer key [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The cost calculation for a complete FR detachment from all teeth was based on 5-min clinical working time for composite removal, plus 6.7-min clinical working time for the FR rebonding procedure. It did not include the cost for a new FR as it was assumed that the existing completely detached FR could be rebonded. The cost calculation for FR debondings at the enamel– or wire–composite interfaces was based on 10 min clinical working time for composite removal and rebonding. The cost calculation for FR wire fracture was based on 5-min clinical working time for composite removal, 5 min for scanning, plus 6.7 min for the FR rebonding procedure. The cost calculation for FR wire fracture included a new FR cost only for the conventional group as the CAD/CAM retainer comes with a 24-month wire fracture warranty.</p>

                <title>Secondary outcome: failures</title>
                <p>Within 24 months, in the maxillary arch, 31 out of 90 CAD/CAM retainers (34%) and 35 out of 91 conventional retainers (38%) failed (total maxillary failures: 66), whilst in the mandibular arch, 38 out of 90 (42%) CAD/CAM retainers, and 36 out of 91 (40%) conventional retainers failed (total mandibular failures: 74). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two groups. The hazard ratios are reported in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The male patients were 1.7 times more likely to encounter failure in the mandibular arch compared to female patients (hazard ratio male to female: lower arch: 1.74 [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.022]). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves for both groups are presented in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The distribution of the maxillary and mandibular first-time failure patterns in each group are illustrated in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Bond failure was the most common pattern of failure in both groups and both arches. In the maxillary arch, debonding at either enamel- or wire–composite interface accounted for about a third each, with wire fracture accounting for a quarter of the failures. In the mandibular arch, more than half of the failures were due to debonding at enamel–composite interface, and almost 30% due to debonding at wire–composite interface. The distribution of failures per tooth is shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The lower incisors were the most prone teeth to debondings.</p>

              <p>Fixed retention aims to maintain orthodontic treatment results in the long term. Besides ensuring teeth remain stable in their new position, FRs must keep the teeth in position without doing any harm and should be cost-effective and comfortable to wear to the patients. To our knowledge, the present RCT is the largest one to compare stability, failure rate, patient satisfaction, and cost-minimization of CAD/CAM nitinol FRs versus MS stainless steel FRs in both maxillary and mandibular arches. There was no significant difference in post-treatment stability, failure rate, and patient satisfaction between CAD/CAM and conventional FRs during a 2-year follow-up period. Thus, CAD/CAM nitinol FRs do not seem clinically more effective compared to established conventional MS stainless steel FRs. Still, CAD/CAM nitinol FRs could be more effective in resisting occurrence of unexpected post-treatment changes in long term due to their possible passive fitting and non-deformability. Furthermore, CAD/CAM FRs were slightly cheaper compared to conventional MS FRs handcrafted by a dental technician, over a 2-year follow-up period.</p>
              <p>Post-treatment stability in terms of LII and arch dimensions was similar between CAD/CAM and conventional failure-free FRs. Nevertheless, in the CAD/CAM FR group, there was a continuous statistically, but not clinically significant increase in LII from a 0.2 mm mean difference at the 6-month follow-up [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to 0.4 mm mean difference at the 24-month follow-up. This minor increase in LII might have also induced a statistically significant decrease in mandibular arch length in the CAD/CAM FR group (mean difference: −1.1 mm) at 24-month follow-up, as changes in the amount of incisor irregularity may also affect the changes in arch length [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The minor increase in mandibular incisor irregularity and decrease in mandibular arch length in the CAD/CAM FR group could be due to superelastic properties of nitinol material [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that ensure that natural, physiological changes characterized by gradual increased anterior crowding and decreased arch length are restricted as little as possible [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly to our findings, previous studies regarding post-treatment stability in terms of incisor irregularity and arch dimensions have found no statistically significant difference between CAD/CAM nitinol and MS FRs [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Over 24 months of follow-up, no unexpected post-treatment changes in terms of torque changes between two adjacent teeth or opposite tipping of contralateral canines with torquing of the whole anterior segment [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were observed in either group. These unexpected post-treatment changes are rare [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but often occur after more than 2 years post-treatment [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and in almost half of the patients [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] may require various types of re-treatment [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>Failure of FRs is a somewhat common clinical complication and may be due to debondings of the wire from a single tooth to multiple teeth, with the failure happening either at the enamel–composite interface or the wire–composite interface, but also due to wire fracture. The prevalence of failure reported in the literature varies substantially, from 1% [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to ~50% [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, the failure rate in the maxillary arch was 34% for the CAD/CAM FRs and 38% for the conventional FRs, whereas in the mandibular arch, the failure rate was 42% for the CAD/CAM FRs, and 40% for the conventional FRs. Thus, in line with previously reported data until 3-year post-treatment [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the present findings indicate that the failure rates for CAD/CAM and conventional FRs were similar over a 2-year post-treatment period. In addition, a study by Kartal and co-authors concluded that CAD/CAM FRs (77% survival rate) and MS FRs (73% survival rate) were similar in terms of survival rates 6 months post-treatment [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Alike our previous 6-month post-treatment data [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the failure rate was lower for maxillary FRs compared to mandibular FRs, notably for CAD/CAM FRs (failure rate: 34% for maxillary CAD/CAM FRs versus 42% for mandibular CAD/CAM FRs). The higher failure rate for the latter might hint that physiological changes regarding incisor irregularity and dental arch dimensions are more pronounced in the mandibular arch and that nitinol material might not withstand age-related tooth position changes.</p>
              <p>In the present study, the most common pattern of failure for both groups and both arches was debonding at either the enamel–composite or the wire–composite interface. A similar pattern of failure could be also observed over 6-month follow-up period [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and thus may reflect the bonding techniques rather than the FRs used. However, wire fractures for maxillary CAD/CAM FRs increased notably from the 6-month follow-up [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to the 24-month follow-up: from 5 wire fractures up till 11 wire fractures, respectively. This may be related to the more brittle nature of nitinol. Conversely, Gelin and co-authors, comparing CAD/CAM FRs to conventional FRs until 1-year post-treatment, reported no FR fractures and observed a similar proportion of debondings with CAD/CAM FRs compared to conventional FRs [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Four other studies comparing CAD/CAM FRs to conventional FRs did not report failure patterns [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Patient experiences associated with FRs are important, as successful retention is reliant on patient compliance in maintaining optimal oral hygiene and care of FRs over long periods. In the present study, there was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between CAD/CAM and conventional FRs. Further, patient satisfaction improved significantly over time for all questions except question 2 (‘How comfortable is it to clean your teeth together with your FRs?’). Gelin and co-authors, comparing CAD/CAM FRs to conventional FRs, found no difference in overall satisfaction and level of discomfort for the tongue with CAD/CAM vs conventional FRs, but did not investigate cleaning issues [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Four other studies comparing CAD/CAM FRs to conventional FRs did not report patient experiences [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>]. Forde and co-authors have previously reported that patients find FRs in general difficult to clean [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>In addition to clinical effectiveness and patient experiences, FRs should also be cost-effective. In the present study, the conventional dental technician handcrafted MS FRs were slightly more expensive than CAD/CAM FRs (approximately 10%). It is worth noticing that the conventional MS FRs used in this study were made by the technicians employed at the universities and hence were ‘virtually’ free of charge. The price used in the calculation for the cost-minimization analysis is the average price charged by a private dental technician laboratory in Norway for handcrafting a conventional MS FR. However, a survey of Norwegian orthodontists revealed that almost all orthodontists manufactured the FRs in-house, which might be much cheaper [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This means that the presented cost-benefit assessment must be interpreted with caution: The cost of conventional MS FRs manufactured by a dental technician is high in Norway and even surpasses the cost of CAD/CAM technology-produced FRs. Yet, the study by Hu and co-authors comparing CAD/CAM FRs and conventional FRs handcrafted by a dental technician found that CAD/CAM method is more time-efficient than conventional method [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], suggesting that FRs fabricated by CAD/CAM technology could be more cost-effective compared to dental technician handcrafted FRs. Nevertheless, the cost for conventional FRs might be lower if the orthodontist fabricates the conventional FRs in house. In-house manufacturing of retainers also removes the dependency on an external laboratory, possibly generating long waiting times between manufacturing and shipping FRs with potential risk for tooth movement, which could be a drawback of CAD/CAM retainers. Regardless of the context, this article provides a calculator where parameters can be modified in order to perform a customized cost-minimization analysis adapted to specific country or setting conditions. Unfortunately, our cost analysis could not be compared to similar studies, as the previous studies comparing CAD/CAM nitinol FRs to conventional MS stainless steel FRs have not analysed cost-minimization [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>In the present study, the CAD/CAM nitinol Memotain® 1.0 FRs were used. After the present study was initiated, an optimized version Memotain® 2.0 has been introduced, which is according to the manufacturer ‘serrated to overcome the sliding effect, designed to fit better at the interdental areas and is assumed to have minimum risk of fracture’. Hence, we could not assess whether Memotain® 2.0 could actually offer better retention to the tooth surface, thus leading to a lower failure rate, specifically at the enamel/wire–composite interface, or reduce the risk of wire fracture.</p>
