              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">Chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease initiated by plaque infection and imbalance of immune response in host defense system, resulting in breakdown of alveolar bone, attachment loss of junctional epithelium and eventually teeth loss. A substantial increase of gram-negative anaerobic rods, especially the red complex (<italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, <italic>Treponema denticola</italic> and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic>) in the subgingival plaque acts a pathogenic role in the incidence and progression of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mechanical debridement as scaling and root planing (SRP) has been repeatedly demonstrated to be effective to remove subgingival pathogens and lead to an improvement of periodontal status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When dealing with deep periodontal pockets, surface irregularities and furcation area, complete removal of plaque and calculus is often proved difficult by SRP alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], thereby providing a rationale for adjunct use of pharmacological therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A series of local anti-infective methods including oral rinses, subgingival irrigation and sustained-release or controlled-release vehicles is aimed at inhibiting periodontal pathogens and alleviate inflammatory response, and has been proved to enhance the outcome of non-surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Green tea catechins extracted from <italic>Camellia sinesis</italic> have been reported to possess an antibacterial effect against gram-negative anaerobic rods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The growth and adherence of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> onto the buccal epithelial cells could be completely inhibited by green tea catechins, especially EGCG exhibiting the strongest antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, EGCG could destroy established <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> biofilms and inhibited biofilm formation with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.5 mg/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As anti-inflammatory reagents, tea extracts dose-dependently reduced the production of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in pathogen-stimulated epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and EGCG suppressed the expression of metalloproteinases-9 in osteoblasts and the formation of osteoclasts in periodontal destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Green tea catechins have been formulated into several forms of sustained-release medication to incorporate mechanical debridement, and demonstrated to be effective in improving its efficacy on periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Local delivery of chlorhexidine as coolants of an ultrasonic scaler has been proposed, which was suggested to permit better access for its administration and might contribute to drug adsorption to root surface, however, the clinical benefits were still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Among studies above, conventional scaler tips were applied for medication, while drugs might fail to be delivered into the bottom of deep pockets via the supragingival outlets, thereby influencing drug effects on treatment outcome. In the present study, a new-type ultrasonic scaler tip was applied for subgingival scaling, through which drug solution could be ejected from the terminal outlet aligned to the bottom of periodontal pockets. Compared with conventional design, the new-type scaler tip could guarantee drugs to be delivered to the bottom, which might provide an alternative vehicle for subgingival medication. Green tea catechins which are readily resoluble in water could be prepared as cooling aqueous supply and medicated as above, however, the pertinent study was scarce up to now.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Hence, this study was designed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of SRP using EGCG aqueous solution as coolants through the new-type ultrasonic scaler tip on chronic periodontitis.</p>

                <p id="Par20">This study protocol was documentarily approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University School of Stomatology (No. PKUSSIRB-201944047) and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. 20 patients were recruited into the study, depending on the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients diagnosed as generalized chronic periodontitis with CAL loss in &gt; 30% of sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and (2) patients systemically healthy, without any disease compromising wound healing. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) smoking, (2) pregnancy or lactation, (3) systemic antibiotics taken within previous 6 months, (4) subgingival scaling received within previous 6 months and (5) less than 10 maxillary teeth except for wisdom teeth. All periodontal sites associated with a PD ≥ 4 mm and bleeding on probing were selected as study sites in maxillary dentition of each subject, except wisdom teeth and teeth considered hopeless or to be extracted. Patients received a description of the study design and provided written informed consent before enrolled in the study.</p>

(Guangdong, China), which could generate ultrasonic vibration at a frequency of 24–33 kHz. Two different subgingival scaler tips used in treatment represented a conventional design (P3, SKL, Guangdong, China) and a new-type terminal-outlet design (Patent No. ZL201820316091.3) which allows coolants to be delivered through the tip and ejected from the apex outlet in addition to ultrasonic vibration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The flow rate of coolants (either water or EGCG solution) was turned up to maximum during ultrasonic scaling.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The ultrasonic scaler tips used in this study. <bold>a</bold> The conventional P3 (up) and new-type scaler tip (down), <bold>b</bold> terminal outlet of the new-type scaler tip allows coolants to be ejected into deep pockets</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2021_1418_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

Determined by high performance liquid chromatography, the purity of this EGCG product was higher than 92%. Within 30 min before each treatment, 5 mg/mL EGCG aqueous solution was prepared with distilled water and stored in one labelled 500 mL coolants container, which was masked and with the cap tightened to avoid light and oxygen interference. The other labelled coolants container was filled with distilled water as control.</p>

The discrepancy from the gingival margin and cemento-enamel junction to the base of the periodontal pockets was recorded to the nearest millimeter as PD and CAL, respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Secondary outcome: bleeding index (BI, Mazza, 1981) and plaque index (PLI, Silness &amp; Löe, 1964) were measured at 2 sites per tooth (buccal and lingual) and the scores from 0 to 5 and 0 to 3 were assessed respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The intra-examiner reproducibility had been calibrated within 2 patients, 336 sites, prior to commencement of the measurement. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of PD and CAL was calculated as 0.969 and 0.959 respectively in duplicate measurements (n = 336), 30 min apart.</p>

                <title>Clinical protocol</title>
                <p id="Par26">Before enrollment, the randomized allocation of maxillary contra-lateral quadrants was determined with a coin-toss method in each subject by the investigator (Q.Y.). All patients received proper oral hygiene instruction and full-mouth supragingival scaling at the first visit. After 2 weeks, baseline recording of clinical parameters and microbiological sampling were performed by the examiner (Y.W.) who was blinded to the allocation. Then, the subgingival treatments were performed by the operator (J.Z.) and accomplished in 4 sessions arranged 1 week apart in each patient. As the split-mouth study design, the left or right maxillary quadrant sites with PD ≥ 4 mm was scaled and root planed with either EGCG solution or distilled water as coolants of the ultrasonic scaler. The sequence of each quadrant treatment was as follows: removing massive calculus and subgingival plaque with ultrasonic scaling (P3 Scaler Tip, SKL), thorough scaling and root planing to the bottom of periodontal pockets with hand instrumentation (Gracey Standard Curettes, Hu-Friedy®, Chicago, United States) until tooth surfaces were smooth and hard, then ultrasonic scaling at least 1 min per tooth (New-type Scaler Tip). Average 30–40 min was demanded for each quadrant where local infiltration anesthesia was conducted if necessary. The volume of either EGCG solution or distilled water consumed in each treatment was approximately 300–500 mL. The patients were informed to report if any discomfort related to the treatment was felt within 1 week.</p>
                <p id="Par27">The patients were recalled 3 and 6 months after treatment. All clinical parameters were recorded as baseline and microbiological samples were taken by the examiner (Y.W.), and the oral hygiene was reinforced when necessary. If there still existed study sites associated with PD ≥ 4 mm, the patients would receive ultrasonic scaling using the new-type scaler tip at a frequency of 24–33 kHz in accordance with the former allocation.</p>

After 3 months, both treatment groups showed statistically significant PD reduction and CAL gain, and SRP plus EGCG didn’t yield additional improvement in these parameters when compared with SRP alone (PD: 3.44 ± 1.29 mm versus 3.47 ± 1.3 mm, <italic>p</italic> = 0.696; CAL: 2.62 ± 2.16 mm versus 2.62 ± 2.18 mm<italic>, </italic><italic>p</italic> = 0.985). However, the changes in PD over the next 3 months were discrepant between two treatment groups.

                <p id="Par34">PD reduction after treatments could be ascribed to the corresponding gingival recession and gain of CAL. In this study, SRP plus EGCG medication obtained a greater PD reduction than SRP alone at month 6, while relative gingival recession (rGC) from the baseline level was similar within two treatment strategies, which indicated that an additional gain of CAL mainly potentiated the PD reduction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par38">As coolants, chlorhexidine has been delivered through conventional scaler tips during SRP, however, the clinical benefits were still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nosal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] evaluated the penetration range of the dye-colored coolant into periodontal pockets of teeth to be extracted and found that through conventional scaler tips the dyed root surface was along full extent of the penetration path, however, had very little lateral dispersion. The teeth to be extracted always have quite loosen periodontal pockets with severe inflammation, while the pockets were relatively tight in teeth to be treated and the penetration range and depth might be limited, thus influencing drug effects. In this study, we applied a new-type scaler tip with the terminal outlet, which could guarantee enough range of subgingival medication and local drugs to be delivered to the bottom of periodontal pockets. Meanwhile, the transport of therapeutic agents towards local tissues might be enhanced in conjunction with ultrasonic cavitation and acoustic microstreaming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Considering the possible subgingival emphysema caused by the new-type scaler tip, the conventional scaler tip was still used first to remove the massive calculus and release the tight periodontal pockets.</p>
              <p id="Par39">As anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory, green tea catechins have been formulated into sustained-release drug, such as gel and strips, as an adjunct to mechanical debridement, while most of them focused on the short-term efficacy less than 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, the extracted catechins mixture was applied to prepare these sustained-release drugs. According to microbiological studies, EGCG exhibited better anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory than other main catechins in green tea extract, therefore, we applied a 5 mg/mL EGCG solution as coolants, which was higher than its minimal inhibitory concentration to periodontal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The pertinent study applying purified EGCG medication on periodontal disease was absent, while our previous study has proved that the concentration as high as 5 mg/mL could maintain stable under ultrasonic vibration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">The split-mouth controlled design was adopted to balance the clinical disease characteristics, such as extent of periodontal inflammation and sufficient site number selected, and the patient-level factors influencing the treatment efficacy between two groups. Only sites with PD ≥ 4 mm in the maxillary dentition were recruited into this study to avoid the possible drug interference via saliva of oral floor, and the dental suction was applied during ultrasonic scaling. After either treatment strategy, the significant PD reduction and CAL gain were obtained at month 3, as 1.8 mm and 1.2 mm respectively, which were in accord with the reported research associated with efficacy of non-surgical treatment on chronic periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, no significant difference in clinical parameters was found between the treatments of SRP plus EGCG and SRP alone at 3-month follow-up. Thus, the selected sites remained PD ≥ 4 mm received repeated ultrasonic scaling using the new-type scaler tip with or without EGCG medication as the allocation before. During the next 3 months, the PD and CAL continued to be improved in the SRP plus EGCG group, while the scenario was different in sites treated SRP alone that these two clinical parameters tended to rebound, thus presenting a significant difference of PD reduction as 0.33 mm and CAL gain of 0.30 mm between groups. Meanwhile, the clinical significance of two treatment strategies was tested with the 2 mm threshold, which was regarded as a clinical level to monitor the disease progression and evaluate the treatment success, and also avoid examination bias of the periodontal probe with 1 mm increment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Compared with SRP alone, a significantly 8% more sites could obtain the PD reduction ≥ 2 mm when treated with additional EGCG medication. Within sites treated with SRP alone in this study, the longitude tendency of PD and CAL was to rebound, which was also observed in previous studies related to mechanical treatment on chronic periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], while the efficacy was maintained with an additional EGCG medication. Among previous studies, only Rattanasuwan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported the study focused on the 6-month longitude efficacy of sustained-release catechins mixture gel on periodontitis, in which PD and CAL also presented a tendency to rebound after 3-month, but no significant discrepancy was found between treatments with or without catechins medication. Although both sustained-release medication and the new-type scaler tip could deliver drugs to the bottom of deep pockets, even the longer acting duration within the former, the combined effect of EGCG and ultrasonic cavitation might be one of the reasons on clinical difference between the study above and ours.</p>
              <p id="Par41">The red complex pathogens were recognized as the most important pathogens associated with periodontitis, which significantly decreased to mean relative abundance &lt; 5% in subgingival microbiome after either treatment, proving the microbial analysis method applied was reliable in this study. However, the analysis of the red complex and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> didn’t show significant differences between the treatments of SRP plus EGCG and SRP alone, and only the pathogen <italic>T. forsythia</italic> showed a significant difference favored the combined EGCG medication. Hattarki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported the sustained-released catechins mixture strips presented an additional antimicrobial effect on <italic>T. forsythia</italic> at 5-week and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> at 1-week. The purified EGCG exhibited a potent anti-microbial effect on <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> biofilms in vitro, while no additional significant difference was found in our in vivo study, which might be ascribed to the relatively shorter exposure time of EGCG solution in the subgingival environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, through repeated medication at 3-month follow-up, an additional microbial effect on <italic>T. forsythia</italic> was found at month-6, which was also observed in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The antimicrobial effect of purified EGCG in vivo needs more clinicomicrobiological studies to verify  in the future. In the present study, the additional PD reduction mainly ascribed to the gain of CAL, which might indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of EGCG on periodontal tissues and the new-type scaler ejecting the drug towards the bottom of deep pockets could contribute the formation of epithelial attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">This study focuses on the long-term efficacy of purified EGCG delivered by the new-type scaler tip, while its effect within 3 months also deserves to be investigated. Furthermore, as another liquid drug, chlorhexidine could exert antibacterial effect and has been applied in periodontal treatments for decades, which also has the potential to be delivered by the new-type scaler tip. Based on our primary results and previous studies, multicenter trial with large sample size should be performed to verify the efficacy of purified EGCG or green tea catechins as periodontal medication and compare with other drugs such as chlorhexidine in the future. For the rational comparison within similar subjects, this study recruited patients with generalized chronic periodontitis which was consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As the new international classification of periodontal diseases has been proposed in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], 18 patients into the final analysis could be diagnosed as generalized periodontitis (stage II or III, grade B) based on their baseline examination, which could provide a reference for future studies using this new classification system.</p>
