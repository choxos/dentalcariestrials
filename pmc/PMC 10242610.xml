              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par7">Lichen planus is a common chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease with unclear etiology. The lesions often involve only the oral mucosa (oral lichen planus, OLP), characterized by multisite or bilateral symmetrical white reticular lesions sometimes accompanied by atrophic, bullous, or erosive lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The global incidence of OLP is approximately 1.01%, and erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP) accounts for 32.46% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Unlike self-limited cutaneous lesions, oral erosions are difficult to self-heal and susceptible to recurrence, frequently causing painful symptoms in patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] The World Health Organization (WHO) has considered OLP to be an oral potentially malignant disorder since 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As a potential risk factor in oral carcinogenesis, 1.05–2.85% of erosions may transform into malignant tumors, imposing a heavy psychological burden on patients with EOLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">According to recent European S1 guidelines, OLP treatment options comprise first-line, second-line, and third-line treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Topical steroids are the preferred drugs against localized erosions, such as clobetasol, fluocinonide, triamcinolone, dexamethasone, and betamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while for widespread or multisite erosions of severe EOLP, the most effective medicines are oral corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For severe EOLP patients with contraindications or recalcitrant erosions to oral prednisone or methylprednisolone, the remaining first-line treatments, cyclosporine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and retinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and some second-line systematic treatments, such as azathioprine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], methotrexate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and mycophenolate mofetil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], can be considered. However, the efficacy of most systemic therapies has not been validated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and long-term use could cause a spectrum of side effects, such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, myelotoxicity and increased risk of infection or malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Among the first-line treatments, topical steroids have been investigated in several prospective studies for treating severe EOLP patients, 42.9 to 93.3% of whom had a good response in decreasing clinical scores and 64.3 to 93.7% of whom had pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is worth noting that the concentration of topical steroids, commonly used in dermatology, might be so high as to cause systemic absorption since the oral mucosa is 4 to 4000 times as permeable as the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, long-term application, usually for 3 to 6 months, leaves patients susceptible to fungal infections, mucosal atrophy, and glucocorticoid resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To prevent oral candidiasis secondary to immunosuppression, antifungal agents are often associated with topical corticosteroids, such as miconazole and chlorhexidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Hence, there is a clinical need for an effective topical agent with a short course of treatment and low concentration to reduce systemic and local side effects. We previously reported the safety and noticeable efficacy of the intralesional compound betamethasone for the treatment of EOLP, and we assumed that soluble betamethasone sodium phosphate (BSP) and slightly soluble betamethasone dipropionate (BD) cooperatively exerted rapid and sustained anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. From this, we proposed a novel hypothesis that short-course, low-concentration betamethasone mouthwash had a dual effect on facilitating fast erosion healing and prolonging the recurrence-free period. We therefore designed this RCT to compare the short-term efficacy of 0.137 mg/mL betamethasone mouthwash for the treatment of severe EOLP with dexamethasone, the most frequently used glucocorticoid mouthwash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par15">The betamethasone mouthwash was prepared by diluting 1 mL of compound betamethasone injection (DIPROSPAN®, MSD Merck Sharp &amp;Dohme AG, Luzern, Switzerland) containing 6.43 mg BD (equivalent to 5 mg betamethasone) and 2.63 mg BSP (equivalent to 2 mg betamethasone) with 50 mL of sterile water (dilution ratio 1:50). The dexamethasone mouthwash was prepared by diluting 1 mL of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) injection (Kingyork Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Tianjin, China) containing 5 mg DSP (equivalent to 3.8 mg dexamethasone) with 20 mL of sterile water (dilution ratio 1:20).</p>
                <p id="Par16">All patients were instructed on how to measure volume both in written and oral forms. Compliance was evaluated by the gargling days until dosage for 2 weeks was used up, and 14 ± 2 days was regarded as good compliance. Drinking and eating were forbidden for 30 min after gargling. Spicy foods and other treatments, except for rescue medicine, were not allowed during treatment. In addition, 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash was applied three times daily before intervention against oral candidiasis in both groups.</p>
                <p id="Par17">The trial included two stages of a 2-week treatment period and one stage of a 3-month observation period for recurrence. When patients were free of erosion and pain symptoms after the first 2 weeks of treatment, they discontinued intervention and entered the observation period. If not, the second 2-week treatment was given. The participants without erosion and pain after 4 weeks of treatment also entered the observation period. If the erosions were still visible at week 4, alternative therapy was given, such as oral glucocorticoids and intralesional injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par18">The primary outcome was the week-2 reduction in erosive area, defined as the difference in erosive area between baseline and week 2. The lesional area was calculated by multiplying the greatest length diameter (mm) and vertical greatest width diameter (mm) using a calibrated dental probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par19">Secondary outcomes were as follows. (a) Week-4 reduction in erosive area, the erosive area difference between week 2 and week 4. (b) Reduced pain level, using a numeric rating scale (NRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to estimate the difference in spontaneous pain before and after treatment. (c) Healing proportion of erosions, presented as participants with erosion healing after treatment/allocated participants × 100%. (d) Reduction in atrophic area and reticular area. (e) Thongprasom sign score, ranging from 0 to 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. (f) Recurrence, including the recurrence interval, recurrence erosive area, and recurrence rate, which was defined as the proportion of participants who experienced recurrent erosions within 3 months.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Safety outcomes included the incidence and severity of AEs. At each subsequent clinic visit, participants were asked to report any local or systemic discomfort and abnormality. We carefully checked for oral fungal infection signs and took oral swabs for direct microscopic examination of fungi before and after therapy.</p>

                <p id="Par22">By reference to our pre-experimental results, the mean difference (MD) of the primary outcome in both groups was assumed to be 18 cm<sup>2</sup>, with a standard deviation (SD) of 30. For 90% power at a one-sided 2.5% significance level, allowing for 20% withdrawal, a sample size of 50 (25 per group) was needed.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Analyses were conducted by two independent investigators who were blinded to the allocation and outcome evaluation using SPSS 22.0.0 and STATA 15.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Quantitative data are presented as the median (Q1 [first quartile]–Q3 [third quartile]) and were analyzed using the <italic>t</italic> test (paired <italic>t</italic> test or independent <italic>t</italic> test) or rank-sum test (Wilcoxon test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). Categorical data are expressed as numbers (%) and were analyzed by the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. The main analysis was carried out on the per-protocol (PP) principle to evaluate the actual efficacy of cases without protocol violations or unassessable outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par24">For the primary outcome, MD with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and <italic>p</italic> value before and after each treatment arm (within-group comparison) or between two groups before and after treatment (between-group comparison) was calculated. If the reduction in lesional area was negative in some aggravating cases, the data of reduction area was adjusted as zero, and the adjusted MD was presented. Secondary outcomes of quantitative data were analyzed by similar methods. For the healing proportion of erosions and recurrence rate, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI and <italic>p</italic> value was calculated.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be performed as sensitivity analyses for the results of PP analyses. The missing data were regarded as invalid responses to treatment, and the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) was applied to supplement the missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Logistic regression was applied to analyze local and systemic risk factors for erosion healing, including erosive area (mm<sup>2</sup>), number of oral erosions, number of affected sides, lesion position (buccal mucosa and/or tongue), Thongprasom score, perilesional supragingival dental calculus (presence or absence), age, and sex, and the forest plot was generated by R language 4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Nineteen betamethasone and seven control patients achieved the disappearance of erosion and pain. However, three control participants complained of no treatment response (reduction of erosive surface ≤ 0 mm<sup>2</sup>) and asked for alternative therapy. Thus, nine betamethasone (31.0%) and sixteen control (57.1%) patients who had no healing erosions continued the second 2-week treatment, but two betamethasone and one control patient were lost to follow-up at week 4.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par38">The compound betamethasone mouthwash in this RCT was a novel pragmatic agent for people suffering from severe EOLP. We revealed for the first time that short-term use of low-concentration betamethasone mouthwash could effectively and safely promote erosion healing and symptom resolution. Compared with 0.181 mg/mL dexamethasone, 0.137 mg/mL betamethasone significantly reduced the erosive area, atrophic area, and pain level, increased the healing proportion of erosions, and prolonged the recurrence interval after 2 weeks of treatment. Sensitivity analyses produced consistent findings with the above results.</p>
              <p id="Par39">There is currently no published RCT comparing therapeutic effects on OLP lesions between betamethasone and dexamethasone, both long-acting corticosteroids. Dexamethasone 0.1–1.0 mg/mL mouthwash is widely used by OLP patients and has been designed as the positive control in many RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. According to glucocorticoid potency conversion, the dose of 0.137 mg betamethasone is approximately equivalent to the dose of 0.137–0.171 mg dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Considering the highest equivalent concentration to betamethasone (&gt; 0.171 mg/mL), efficacy and side effects of different concentrations reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and convenient dilution (ratio 1:20), we used 0.181 mg/mL dexamethasone as the control.</p>
              <p id="Par40">The risk factor analyses demonstrated that the efficacy of promoting erosion healing was not significantly influenced by potential local and systemic factors. The superiority of betamethasone over dexamethasone might be explained in the following three aspects. First, 0.137 mg/mL betamethasone exhibited much higher anti-inflammatory potency than 0.181 mg/mL dexamethasone. Although these two concentrations have not been included in the common potency ratings of topical corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], it is generally known that 0.1% DSP cream, 0.1% betamethasone valerate (BMV) cream, and 0.05% BD cream are graded as low potency (Class VII), moderate potency (Class V), and high potency (Class III), respectively, indicating the higher potency of betamethasone than dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Second, the compound betamethasone contains not only rapidly hydrolyzed BSP but also slowly metabolized BD that could be retained in erosions with less influence from saliva dilution and flush. Kopylova et al. found that betamethasone was detectable in all human urine samples (<italic>n</italic> =20) 28 days after Diprospan® injection, and the complete elimination extended up to 48 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, the mean interval of erosion recurrence in our betamethasone patients was 40.3 days, suggesting that there was a longer hydrolysis period of BD in the mouth. Third, betamethasone might promote erosion recovery and reduce the patient’s symptoms by blocking the association of local lesions with systemic factors. Although not clear, the pathogenesis of OLP is generally considered T-cell-mediated epithelial barrier damage, which is responsible for the occurrence of local erosions and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Eating might be too painful for patients to receive a normal diet and adequate nutrition, causing weight loss, impairment in immune cell activity, and mental disorders, such as stress, anxiety, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, these psychological disorders as potential predisposing factors, contributing to activation of the host immunological responses toward local oral mucosa, might in turn cause exacerbation or recalcitrance of erosions, forming a vicious cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The rapid anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving actions of betamethasone help disrupt this vicious cycle as early as possible (and earlier than dexamethasone) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and recover regular diet and nutrient uptake to maintain proper immune cell functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the vicious circle of oral lichen planus (OLP) between inflammation and psychological disorders. Patients with erosive OLP tend to suffer pain and psychological disorders. Stress results in the release of cortisol to promote Th2 cell differentiation and mast cell degranulation, secreting cytokines for basement membrane disruption. Depression and anxiety can elevate the levels of proinflammatory cytokines to enhance immune cell migration. Under the effects of psychological disorders, oral keratinocytes are more prone to be destroyed by cytotoxic T cells, aggravating inflammation, pain, and psychological disorders. The fast anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of betamethasone could block this vicious cycle, facilitating a rapid healing process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="784_2023_5051_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par41">Previous RCTs of applying topical betamethasone for EOLP have demonstrated its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Hegarty et al. found that 22 patients had a mean 42.91% reduction in lesional area and a 29.73% reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) after using a 6-week 0.005% BSP mouthrinse (0.5 mg tablet dissolved in 10 mL water) without AE. Ezzatt and Helmy showed that 15 patients receiving 0.1% BMV cream had significant reductions in clinical scoring (mean ± SD 63.41% ± 18.10%) and VAS (95.42% ± 4.12%) at week 4, and 3 patients (20.0%) had a burning sensation or taste alteration. Samimi et al. detected that 0.05% BD ointment decreased the median erosive surface by 98.8% in 36 patients at month 3, 30 of whom (83.3%) reported AEs. The above findings suggested that the higher the concentration or potency of betamethasone, the better the anti-inflammatory effect and the higher the risk of AEs. In this study, 28 participants using 2 weeks of betamethasone had significant reductions in erosive area (88.16% ± 22.52%) and pain level (92.26% ± 19.50%), with a low rate of adverse reactions (7.1%), displaying its comparable efficacy of potent cream/ointment and good safety with short course and low concentration. Apart from the dual-acting betamethasone ingredients, the diluted liquid dosage not only had better access to all oral lesional sites to improve inflammation conditions adjacent to erosions but could rapidly contact erosions by directly releasing active molecules from water. In addition, mouthwash was much easier to use for any oral location and to reduce drug residence time in the mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">Both types of mouthwash had an acceptable safety profile. The reported dry mouth and burning sensation were common side effects of topical corticosteroids, which might be due to elevated nervous excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Given the characteristics of high efficacy and low toxicity, betamethasone mouthwash could be a good candidate for the treatment of EOLP. The significant effects on enhancing erosion healing and extending the recurrence interval could reduce the revisit frequency of patients, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We did not monitor betamethasone plasma levels with the long excretion period of BD and no impact on plasma cortisol levels in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Of note, because most of the data followed non-normal distributions in this trial, the median might look dissimilar in the two arms, such as the erosive surface at baseline. Therefore, we also added the mean and SD in the supplementary figures (Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1-S8</xref>) to display data variability.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Although over 20 scoring systems have been used to grade the severity of OLP, such as the Thongprasom score and Reticular–Erythematous–Ulceration (REU) system, there is no gold standard scoring system or uniform definition of severe EOLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Referencing our previous method of defining refractory OLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], we proposed the inclusion criteria for severe EOLP based on the classic Thongprasom score (≥ 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] to facilitate quick identification by oral clinicians without complicated algorithmic summation.</p>
              <p id="Par44">The primary study limitation was the lack of patient-blind implementation with the different mouthwash physical appearances. Second, there was a larger difference in the number of patients receiving the second 2-week treatment because 67.9% of betamethasone patients entered the observation period after the first 2-week therapy. Additionally, using the calibrated dental probe to calculate lesional area (mm<sup>2</sup>) might yield some measurement bias, especially for lesions with irregular shapes. Therefore, we first divided an irregular lesion into several regular calculating parts and then combined their areas together to reduce measurement error. A software or scanner for automatically calculating oral lesional areas is clinically needed in the future.</p>
